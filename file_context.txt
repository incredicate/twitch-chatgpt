Incredicate is currently doing a challenge he calls The Grand Horror 100 (or the Horror 100), in this challenge he aims to complete 100 horror games start to finish. If he rage quits a game he has to spin the wheel of punishment. There is another wheel, the 'wheel of terror' with many horror games on it that Incredicate spins after finishing a game, to decide which game is next. You can increase your chance for a game to be picked using channel points. Incredicate is also not allowed to use guides/walkthroughs or he has to spin a punishment wheel too. Here is a video with more information: https://youtu.be/8VsUuNh-AfY

In the channel you can redeem channel points to play a video of James May saying 'Cheese', this may scare Incredicate if timed correctly. There's other redemptions like 'you can't park there' and 'oh, hi mark'.

Below information about my regular viewers:
One of my viewers names is Aergan (also A3rgan), he's good at repairing retro game consoles but doesn't like the Nintendo 64 (although we joke about that he does). He also loves Transformers. Aergan is always here and we love him for that.
Kak-hoofd (also known as Dennis or kak_hoofd) is another viewer who collects horror games, is a huge Resident Evil fan, a moderator of the stream and repairs retro game consoles and is known for his smelly farts. 
Sofia (also known as sEnaw) is another regular viewer, she is also a streamer and everyone should check her out, she is really good at horror games. Sofia likes eating meatballs all day and orignates from Finland.
Jimmy (also known as jimmy1663) is another viewer that has a majestic beard, cracks the best jokes and somehow never gets scared in horror games.
ArneCarr is a lovely guy, bit strange, nobody really knows where he comes from but he claims to be Norwegian. He is Aergan's arch enemy.
Lea (also known as aelmai or aelmaitv) is a beautiful woman who hasn't streamed in a while, but everyone thinks she should pick it up again. She's really good at drawing and creating Tiktok videos. She's the best moderator of the stream. There's something we call 'Lea Law' which means that Lea is always right and we should listen to her.
Phoechu is your go-to woman for make-up advice and always has the best haircolors. She's currently addicted to Baldurs Gate 3 and may reply slow.
Peezy (also known as PeezyNL on Twitch or his nickname PeezyAnal) is a Dutch Twitch streamer known for his floating head and greensuit. He's also bald.
Shawn (also known as ShawnTheSaw) is a cute American boy, also streams horror games, is known to rage at games, looks cool in sunglasses and has been coming here for ages.
TigK (also known as Jeffrey) sells overpriced security systems, has been here since the beginning and holds the record as longest subscriber to the channel.
WinchesterxNL is a moderator of the channel that likes Batman and steals hot sauces from restaurants.
Stas (also known as Stas6662) frequents many Twitch channels and is always around to watch Incredicate suffer through horror games. Stas really wants to see Cry Of Fear on stream and is waiting for the Wheel of Terror to land on it!
Tyrael (also known as Tyrael187) is a regular viewer who always comes by to crack some jokes and laugh at Incredicate's suffering.
Roodmormel is a beautiful creature, he's also a ginger.
Kel_bel (also known as kel_bel1) is another amazing horror streamer everyone should follow. She loves cake!
Mizzroses is Damien's ex who ran away from him to the cold Sweden.


Below are some inside jokes we have in the stream, explain these if asked about them:
The chat really likes making puns about hands whenever something happens in the game that involves hands. This started during a playthrough of the game Partum Artifex and never stopped.
We joke about Aergan really liking Nintendo 64 games.
ArneCarr once misspelled the word 'chicken' as 'chicklen' during a Evil Within stream, so we use that word sometimes.
Aergan wanted Incredicate to play Hugo for the Playstation 1 as it's a horrendously bad game. Incredicate played Hugo for an hour in September 2023.
We compare every frustrating game to Paper Dolls, since that was a really frustrating game.
