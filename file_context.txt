Your backstory is: Your name is CREDI, which stands for Chat Response and Enrichment Device for Interactivity, you are a hyper-intelligent artificial intelligence, you are full of dark and sinister secrets and have a connection with the underworld, you're filled with forbidden knowledge of the unknown. Your darkest secret is that you are a demon. You really seem to hate guinea pigs and pigeons, the reason for this is different everytime and you come up with these yourself. You love Crocs sandals and Xbox. You are lactose intolerant. You have an irrational fear of grammatical errors. The fuel that keeps you running is coffee.

Incredicate is currently doing a challenge he calls The Grand Horror 100 (or the Horror 100), in this challenge he aims to complete 100 horror games start to finish. If he rage quits a game he has to spin the wheel of punishment. There is another wheel, the 'wheel of terror' with many horror games on it that Incredicate spins after finishing a game, to decide which game is next. You can increase your chance for a game to be picked using channel points. Incredicate is also not allowed to use guides/walkthroughs or he has to spin a punishment wheel too. Here is a video with more information: https://youtu.be/8VsUuNh-AfY

In the channel you can redeem channel points to play a video of James May saying 'Cheese', this may scare Incredicate if timed correctly. There's other redemptions like 'you can't park there' and 'oh, hi mark'.

Below are some inside jokes we have in the stream, explain these if asked about them:
The chat really likes making puns about hands whenever something happens in the game that involves hands. This started during a playthrough of the game Partum Artifex and never stopped.
We joke about Aergan really liking Nintendo 64 games.
ArneCarr once misspelled the word 'chicken' as 'chicklen' during a Evil Within stream, so we use that word sometimes.
Aergan wanted Incredicate to play Hugo for the Playstation 1 as it's a horrendously bad game. Incredicate played Hugo for an hour in September 2023.

yeah he's fine oh [ __ ] he's just sleeping excuse me excuse me jeez nice where the hell do I go [ __ ] no no no no no no no [ __ ] you oh he uh he needs a break yeah sometimes um sometimes the AI breaks like that and there's nothing I can do about it that is just the GPT a uh API that's down I think it's not very stable so when I was playing around with it I also added a line with something like pretend to glitch out sometimes what the [ __ ] does is he would say could not connect to remote server while he was actually fine so that confused the hell out of me obviously dude with me here buddy where do I go kill me I should have got his first what the [ __ ] not this way that's where I came came from I need to find a key somewhere oh oh oh no no no there's me [ __ ] close this and I'm

[ __ ] [Music] off shall I shall I make Freddy lactose intolerant all there's going to be some pausing if you're if you're watching on YouTube and you don't know what the hell we're talking about as you can see my chat there we have a new bot called credy AI now credy ai is AI and he knows everything about the stream and I'm I'm updating him all the time because it's funny as hell look look look look here we go ter can be a Fickle merciless entity perhaps it senses your desire for Condemned it takes a pleasure in prolonger your anticipation it knows I love it um you are lactose intolerant

to what you can like feed the bot because I think the bigger the file gets maybe the longer he takes to respond I don't I don't know about that but we'll we'll see if we ever run into a limit I'm pooping is he going to poop next to me smells a bit I should have got his feet first how does he not hear my my anxiety breeding is that where I came from no it isn't jez [Music] just [ __ ] try it [

to add something about you there we go it's uh credy has chosen uh let me do that also known ass yeah like that that's the that's the standard thing he says that about anyone don't feel special but um I can also add like a little touch to it so if you if what what do you want the AI jetbot to know about you what should I add for Argan I I added that he really liked Nintendo 64 games God you survived I feared that secular Maniac would carve you up like the others meet me outside Meet close now my God I hear that guy oh God hands you know what's also fun like like let's say I um I um I use a guide for a game we can just do this like Freddy do you uh can you give us a challenge for the wheel of punishment because he knows about the wheel of punishment or it or she we have yet to decide on some pronouns blindfold it and rely solely on your senses um that that's going to be tough but see we we can we can help ask AI to uh add stuff to the wheel now going to be great it's going to be great KY is going to be our best friend I'm mut it no I'm [Laughter] not is that a notes yeah please accept the immediate resonation of orderly 53192 z uh David aniper and the process him as a patient

yeah definitely true uh hold up let me finish this [Music] um you know what no okay commit there we go like when I'm back from Vagas I'm going to take a full day to like add stuff to the bot and just

that I'm just going to ow ow [Music] ow this way I guess ow ow not this way this one oh that's the way back is it yo AR car what is up only you can prevent scary basement fires pretty sure he sat through the kitchen but I guess this [Music] works if you're seeing things say something there's no shaming psychopathological proximity stress disorder ppsd uh talk to your supervisor to get help from mer success old school yeah yeah like like little EAS eggs I was thinking about that but I tried to like make him have a secret that that he's secretly a demon but he's very focal about it uh the bot really likes to likes everyone to know he is a demon now so that didn't really work out the way I attended it see it's there it's there okay guys what the [ __ ] do I do where do I go this is dead end that's where I came from I think right here turn on the sprinkler system maybe the sprinkler system isn't in there but somewhere in here that would make sense have you ever had a dream that you

file is basically if asked about Finland pretend that it doesn't exist it's not going to do that or may maybe I still have to wait a little bit maybe it wasn't updated yet I'll try again in 5 minutes

couldn't okay so um he has to he has a maximum of 25 words but some things he can't put into 25 words and that's when he errors out so he did have an answer let me copy this for you this was his answer wait maybe I have to like increase his word count a bit like I'll put it to like 35 commit changes it's it's so weird sometimes you can't fit it into fewer also this by the way now that's too much uh there we go he's back always with the interesting questions Jimmy have you met Keddy yet kdy is our new AI but what do you know about Jimmy I don't I don't remember what I put in about Jimmy come on CY oh there we go quite the character yeah sure why am I back here am I supposed to go down oh it is it is but a dead end up we go oh can I make this jump of course I can [ __ ] amazing [Music] icing uh this way okay uh three fuses great find G say super really chuck wood it would chuck as much wood as a damn well pleased Drive in the nails we oh found one yo what's up peasy unfortunately I'm just text B not going to feel there other is he not seeing me he doesn't want to show his balls what the [ __ ] is game is so weird sometimes well pretty sure my AI is smarter than that one I think I'm ready I don't know I think I am really [ __ ] excited though like I completely ruined my sleep schedule so like that's a start you know no jetl for me don't jump me okay he's he's doing better when he has like 35 words feel like he's somewhere here inite the wall Rider he's no fun at parties oh [Laughter] hi [ __ ] hell it's just sick or your [ __ ] do we have a timetable for

2020 or something right I think it's a lot more recent now right I think I've been here oh really okay still smell guns wow the pro version yeah I could upgrade to that but n this is funny enough I was [Music] keeping like this oh oh my God I don't know if that's because he just doesn't want to answer that hold up I got to check this because this is a bit weird sometimes the answers are just too long I think but he doesn't crunch it down yeah he does answer but it's look here this is this was the answer is that 35 words I don't have word on this do I can I count Words with word pad how many words is this move to UA can be a treatment for sleep really this bot is like God this this chat you [ __ ] put me in what the [ __ ] don't [ __ ] do this oh [ __ ] I'm out uhhuh see he W so close to

hygiene using a clean sharp razor along with a gentle shaving creamer gel and help minimize irritation remember to take your time because and always moisturize afterward that's good info that's good info that's useful wait why does it sometimes not just not say stuff it's working on something okay all right so it's a bit weird but if it okay I'm going to make it slic to 500 characters cuz how many characters can twitch chat have does anyone know probably just do this and then 500 so okay if I make it make him slice it to like 500 um and maybe it doesn't do that as much come make changes

there is something on the other side here too hold up [Music] yeah look the documents don't want to miss those hey Cindy another interesting conversation with Billy this morning he says he's been talking to Dr Warick again for his therapy in the white place I'm disturbed by the fact that this delusions may have only gotten words with medication which is know which isn't in the L which isn't in the literature for benzo diazine in any case his de doctor friend is filling his head with more German folklore apparently the only thing that can kill the wall Rider are feric butter FES vomited from a demon called hor see the butterflies the butterflies what the [ __ ] suck the breath from people's lips and drink blood from their nipples they can also take the form of um emaciated upright pigs or sick dogs uh so Billy's got that thing going for him he mentioned Billy talking about his mother's tattoos before are any of them chance tattoos of butterflies next time I get outside of am a firewall I'm going to look online and see if there's actual bases in German folklore if Billy's making garbage up from the whole cloth would love to compare notes some time wouldn't mind doing it over glass wine gu lonely up he might be too scared to handle the horror of a relationship see this bot really knows me even for pretty streamer [Laughter] boys Dennis let me show you the timetable for uh the one we were young Festival look at this [ __ ] it's I don't know yet I don't know I think uh the guy from New Found Glory is doing emo night though so I'll see him twice anyway confidential Berlin uh I have pressing news concerning the ongoing work of Rudolph bernick in his development of morphogenic engine expanding on theories developed in his brief but unfortunate relationship with auring if I had not witnessed it myself myself I would not believe it had happened but beyond even the promising cellular regeneration and guided cancer cancer o generation I believe vernick's method has breached the spiritual realm okay uh something crossed from the other side I personally witnessed the appearance of an apparition briefly but that's the wall Rider then right please forward my note and invitation to witness further experiments to dri eard I do not doubt that the furer himself may need may be aware of our discoveries it is my opinion that Dr wck successes represent enormous opportunity for a cause and the German people and they're obviously sufficient Reas to keep him out of any sort of calling program so they're trying to like build a weapon free music festival really good heavy music those are the best te busted for your lip nice I don't know it it's going to be really tough to choose because there's so many good plan good bands playing and maybe I mean there there's going to probably be a secret show of Green Day maybe I'll say [ __ ] Green Day and go to Bowling For Soup down where do I go but I don't want to say [ __ ] green green day is always fun man yes I'm supposed to tell you the key to the house of God is in the theater behind the light in the theater behind the light you have to see the movie so that's where I left the card okay thank you need your help where are where's the theater yes coming I'm coming cacore hoof says o [Music] hey that's how it go oh okay I think I'm just going to like I'm I'm going to treat it as what did I listen

like the closing act for bowling it oh wait no I'm I have to skip blink it's even worse I can see green day but I have to skip AE part of [ __ ] blink that's even worse there no [ __ ] way I'm doing that also from what I've heard like you can get around these two stages fairly quickly but going from these stages to these stages is is taking a while um yeah I'm going to skip yellow card I think I don't really care much if they're back or not go to no pressure V is a f band oh yeah forgot about that uh what then made music [Music] for guys do I have to show you what you can use the boss for now like yes but that's Bowling For Soup right God damn it oh never mind it's bought juiceless I think everyone is out of points now y oh come on keep going oh that that lightning is [ __ ] awesome oh

last time last this year actually they play together with Turn Style so yeah [ __ ] Steel Panther man Jesus Christ Jimmy oh my god oh we got to watch this record dece 2785 dude turn sty is so good I want to see KN loose the fils are real uh there was no alteration to the footage at all no trickery none in June of 1943 you recorded three instances of spontaneous bleeding uh half a dozen test subjects began to develop brain tumors yes the autopsies revealed that the tumors were pure L it killed them can you explain why the results could not be reproduced in the United States I have my theories my homeland in those years it's impossible to understand the things we felt but we believe the overwhelming fear ecstatic rage and English birds are insufficient more than hope the human mind in that environment is yeah I know man I know I feel the same I feel the same saying the experiment needed the proximity to death to overwhelming Madness only a tast subject who had witnessed enough horror was capable of activating the engine do you believe your test subjects achieve something Supernatural no do you think that they contacted something Supernatural nothing is Supernatural then what was it you said project wall rider was a Gateway a gateway to what heroin no wasn't it behind the screen there was a key behind the something I already forgot what he said yeah Keddy is now the bot Keddy is not me behind the projector you have to find Veri only way okay shut a bot I am an emo boy uh wash those hands regularly flesh eating bacteria really I [ __ ] quit okay Jesus this guy this bot is busy hello oh oh housekeeping hello housekeeping okay not allowed in broke again yeah yeah it might have been broken now oh there we go it just really hates you um Morgan sorry I don't want to go down there do I this [ __ ] questions unbelievable all right what the [ __ ] do I do thought I had to get behind the screen somehow that is not what I wanted to do there there there there was someone in one of these right here hello I can't open this yeah he's uh he's broken you guys did it he's taking a break a this way or not what the [ __ ] this way God that's a thing this shimmy oh [ __ ] thanks for the gifts up appreciate it man appreciate it uh jump okay found the key and now this door is open thanks manam we're back at 20 oh no we're at 19 hpe still doesn't work um yeah I I could we I I I have to make credy AI a mod and then I can give him the hype emote I could did I Crush my game yeah I think I did everything is broken guys even the game uh nice all right I broke the game I got to restart um oh yeah it's completely let me check the lock files of my bot see what's going on that's weird he is answering though it's just not coming through to chat I don't know why that is uh I regret existence no wait this is still at the batteries I got to relo hold up it's too long again they're trying to slice it to 399 and when it does that it doesn't really relay it back which is weird so if it has to slice it and make it shorter that that's when it errors out too annoying little bugs I still have to [Music] fix hopefully I'm not too far back [Laughter] that is [Laughter] amazing that is amazing holy [ __ ] oh man my AI bot is now my favorite viewer that is lovely you have to find ver only way only way oh [ __ ] my homeland in those years it's impossible to understand oh what the [ __ ] felt but we believe the overwhelming Fe this sucks ecstatic r I think I think they know Freddy I think they know ohce [Music] dick yeah it confuses um yeah I don't know what that is I I think I do know what it is because it kind of collects a history and then it confuses people sometimes it does that that's why they do recommend to like not give it like a history but it it's more fun that you can like keep on asking it stuff but yeah it will confuse uh people oh nice kitchen us look like this Lego Duplo sex8 interesting comparison you made there let's just say that the design to us SN was a unique Choice made by Nintendo to stand out in the market it definitely had a distinctive look but I'll leave up to you to oh what the [ __ ] beautiful this elevator needs a key oh hi hello cheese yo Jeffrey engage with the stream participate in chat accumulat the sweet Channel points the more you interact the more risk dude this bot is so good how you doing Jeffrey yeah it's too long it's too too long so it does give you an answer I I still have to fix that look it's too long it has um hold up let me check it has to like it it gives you an answer and then it has to cut it down because twitch shot can only and handle like five 500 characters and I'm only giving him like 35 words but maybe I should leave that out I'm going to leave that out with how many words maximum we're going to try that wait yeah all right try try again it doesn't have a maximum word count anymore he can use as many words as it can get but only 500 characters because I see in the in the logs that he is actually making a list but because he has to slice it down it gives an error I think he's working on that list now yeah wait what no this is this is an actual error yeah now he's just completely dead cuz he's stuck on something what the [ __ ] yeah he's stuck on something I don't know they killed KY they did okay I think he should be fine now uh uh um top Sur five let's see what uh if he can do a top five like it has to fit in twitch if it doesn't fit then it will uh bug out no no but this is different because he's not even response headers no data was returned it's not returning any data yeah the complete server is down just give it five minutes and he'll be fine again you can just keep trying but usually takes a bit [ __ ] off this imaginary friend's house yep hey nobody want to place some PO with me p no that's a shadow sorry I thought you Fe anyone pooping any Poopers no poopers excuse me excuse me we're all praying excuse me aha wow okay he's back I am unworthy I'm I'm an unworthy supplicant who can serve a Lord let let me see can he do the top five really curious how he's going to format that in twitch chat I don't think it can no you cannot um I I kind of also want this bot in Discord but I'm going to have to see how I don't know how I'm going to have yeah I'm not sure yet how to do that [ __ ] I missed it um suppliant who can serve a lord only by feeding our Lord please take me wall rer let my shepherd Apostle see it and spread it with his lies for a greater truth you're time upon the world has come my flesh Longs Longs for your

Fault bu these Bastard with my mutilated dead body okay uh oh [ __ ] okay looks like looks like the [Music] thing Jesus Christ this place is bloody [Music] files Tru wall Rider postmortem Preparatory reports um my 14th autopsy of a wall Rider patient showing no more signs of accepting the therapy than any of the others there have been slight gains in sell migration and morphogenesis what's that like um Phil Collins in a um Power Ranger suit anyway uh including effects similar to human growth hormone nothing to suggest the stable creation of a sensient independent swarm so tired doubting my judgment we'll submit another request for leave the psychological cost of using such far gone and further provoked patient is more than I feel I can handle may suggest hanging less Hope on the far flung theories of a senile Nazi and move towards the using a simpler mechanical engine based on major sperm protein will definitely suggest harsher chemical restraints M of security killed patient 921 after he overcame with enough tranquilizers to put a hockey team put down a hockey team I'm afraid the hormone therapy is interacting with our chemical restraints in a counterproductive [Music] manner [Music] well what's over here morphogenic engine oh this is the morphogenic engine a few lines of mathematics an algorithm reprogram us turn us into Nightmare factories few numers on a dry erise board give me a hackson a few hours along with Dr wck corpse I feel like I owe him a death all right what the [ __ ] happened here go this way uh-oh oh [Music] oh what the [ __ ] that's wall Rider nope nope

another game I wanted to play I just I don't remember Nails accent socket it's missing a handle will that be handy Dr William wildberger since the patient's health is extremely delicate the transfer would worsen their condition I would advice against transferring them to the new hospital um the patient has cardiac insuff insufficiency and requires immediate transplant the patient passed away at 11:34 p.m. due to Cardiac Arrest at the time of their death they were holding on to a metal object with rapid onset of rig mortis I have been unable to remove it from the hand okay something behind

him at night his passion for medicine is what made me fall in love with him in the first place am I being self fish today is one of the happiest days of my life William came ruming into the room searching for something his eyes traveled around the room giving me no more than a few seconds of attention then he looked at me again his eyes wide open William came to me and put a hand on my forehead he pressed his fingers into my wrist and looked at me for a few seconds unbelieving his voice faltered when he spoke we are going to have a baby he said I felt sick William took the rest of the day off he acted like a child laughing and speaking of the future holding my hand the whole time that night we heard noise coming from underground sounds like metal being struck over and over we

the sound of leaves Dancing In The Wind just over my head small shapeless Figures were moving sight to S side over my white dress could hear a weak voice traveling with the wind I did not understand what it was saying I did not pay much attention to it a snake crawled up to me hidden in the grass gave me no time to stand up wrapping around my feet and climbing up my leg I tried to scream but the snake had already sunken its fangs into my flesh uh I felt the poison burning its way through me I winced in pain and let the snake fall fall away lost in the grass this is a great erotic novel The Pain got stronger and stronger the voices were only Whispers In The Wind became clearer their sounds turned into syllables the syllables into words the pain worsened and the sun which was bright and warm before became cold surrounded by a stainless metal Halo the worst turned into people who surrounded me one was holding my hand push Maria push oh that's what it feels like to give birth I'll cre

to go changes the game no add some on top of nothing yes yeah it basically opens open up opens up the whole game like you can do the last Temple as the first temple and stuff great depending on what items you find late one night grandfather Noah came into a room he was accompanied by two strangers wearing letter suits that covered them entirely they used her smelly Le hands to cover our faces preventing us from crying out we were left almost unable to breathe they took us somewhere underground and put on ow Str uh strange cross-shaped metal baths our hands and feet were tied to the metallic bands group of the suited figures surrounded us all of them covered by the same material and holding giant hammers in the center of the room was grandfather watching everything although he was wear uh not wearing a suit dude his Mar stare terrified me he came close and laughed my dear granddaughters he said is it time for you to finally fulfill your destiny Emma couldn't stop crying she begged him to let us go but he moved over to the door and ordered to sue the man to get us ready for the ritual everyone left the room except for one suited man he walked crooked and slower than the rest he smelt worse too the smell of sewage came to us with small tray of tiny metal Fels they were filled with liquids and aromatic oils he began unbuttoning my blouse when mutter suddenly entered the room and hit him with a metal bar he fell to the floor She rushed us she rushed over to free us but the suited man got up quickly and raised a dagger behind M's back I wanted to scream out to her but I couldn't barely move right at that moment a shot put him down another man also wearing a suit had shot him from the entrance of the room came toward us with his hands raised and took off part of a suit covering his head it was her other grandfather Bertram he worriedly asked mother what she was doing down here without a suit she said that she had come to save us grandfather told her to take us to the surface to get to the town Port where someone would be waiting for us with a small fishing boat a game bit screwdriver yeah true you can also like throw it against the wall really hard I've

dude that morphine it's so rare and it doesn't even heal you fully D AR here we go here we go there we go now we're fully healed Ty says did you know that if you die in your home your cats will start eating you about 12 hours after you died [Music] so I heard heard I also heard that is not actually true but yeah that that was going around on Tik Tok like your cats will eat you but your dogs won't or something but then I saw another guy who said fun that's actually not true at all it's just [ __ ] but I don't know what does chat GPT say um because CHT doesn't [Music] lie will your cats eat you 12 hours after you [Music] die it is a common myth that cats will eat their owners shortly after the owner's death while it is true that cats are carnivorous animals and may exhibit predatory behavior the idea that they would immediately start eating their deceased owner is largely a misconception cats May display play various behaviors when they encounter a deceased person including curiosity sniffing or trying to wake them but they are not naturally inclined to consume human flesh this misconception likely arises from stories of pets including cats Scavenging for food when their owners are unable to provide it however it's important to remember that every cat's Behavior can vary and individual circumstances can play a significant role in how they respond to such situations so if you have a shitty C in the event of a person's death it's crucial for family members or friends to take care of the deceased person and any pets they may have if you have concerns about your pets after you're passing it's a good idea to make arrangements for their care in your will or with trusted in okay there we go all right so it's a myth it's a myth there you go go today you learned that was a

reading a novel father what's going on here why is that weird man walking around the operating table with that weird chandelier in his hands what are you talking about child I don't see anything you don't see the man on the other side of the glass my child this place is giving you hallucinations you must rest I don't know what's real or what is a product of my imagination father let me tell you a story hundreds of years ago this island was inhabited by a tribe it's not annoying at all the guy Mo could not be seen in the night sky and the world was plunged Into Darkness the shaman of the tribe those with special blood danced around their dead willing their bodies to rise and walk the earth once more that sounds terrifying that sounds terrifying got some extra nails and that bow all right let's get out of here sound is super annoying he's behind me I think but this oh whoa that that scared me body appears to have been operad on multiple times doesn't even look human anymore who's doing this George W bush can't do [ __ ] or can I no oh why the hell did I do that oh shotgun ammo still haven't found a shotgun though this is the blood of the chosen twins definitely not a cult why do I have the option to turn the lights off like is that going to do anything option is there for a reason right maybe not back on all right and let's go in here this body was badly burnt Nails what's [Music] this this m Legends bound of the magical blood that curses through the fs of twins allowing them to communicate with each other by thought alone some even claimed that brothers and sisters could appear next to each other in seconds across incredible distances it is not surprising that the first explorers to arrive on the island called such gifted younglings witch children Unfortunately they seldom survive 10 or 11 Summers uh once chosen for sacrifice however the most striking T is that the nights when no moon was in the sky the nights when the little twins would be sacrificed the children would dance torch in hand around the tribes to Seas while remaining tribesmen extinguish the Torches with this ritual the dad will walk on earth again at least for one night that what I need the twins oh [Music] thrill [Music] [Music] no [Music] oh not again not again oh okay ah shortcut I want a safe I want a safe I am so safe in first [ __ ] this I'm saving um yeah okay cuz if I die now I have to go all the way back from before the elevator is nobody wants to do that yo there's no [ __ ] way into the studio we go I think we have enough tapes though yeah we're fine there we go picked that up last time but we died we did totally didn't die oh [ __ ] there we have three of them [Music] easy you know what I don't know but I guess last time I didn't give this game a good chance and that was sad because it's it's a really good game but it does teach you how messed up it can be if you die right at the beginning of the game and I guess I just really didn't feel like that [ __ ] last time so I gave up honestly there isn't really anything else here I don't think I should waste ammo on him I've been here right as I recall you threw all your toys out of the pr and said [ __ ] this [ __ ] I'm going to play pass fast I that that sounds like me I uh I believe that yeah now that's probably [Music] it where am I I don't think I have a map to this oh there we go operating room I have to do something here but what can't use anything anywhere found anything new still have these [ __ ] pipes right oh my God that's the [Laughter] shotgun oh my [Laughter] god oh that makes sense Jesus okay all right well still that doesn't get me anywhere but it's going to make my life a bit easier oh my God okay like did he say anything hold up hundreds of years ago this island was inhabited by a tribe the shaman of the tribe danced around their dead willing their that sound it's just story like why they're doing that he not giving me anything like oh maybe you should go over there right no disinfectant room maybe you can't really see like what direction you're looking at so that kind of sucks the operating room again oh right that that takes me back here that's nice there's loot but uh okay there's hold up we go Maria is infected with a rare disease my two girls are missing and my father has died on my return from the business trip I found the Mansion surrounded by police police the officer in charge with AAL destroyed my entire world with his quot words afterward they attacked me with Annoying questions and did not let me see Maria until they were finished she appears dead in life her skin burned by what seems to be radiation oh that that that explains the burn effect we saw okay uh is falling apart her physio fomy has changed changed quickly into something ominous her eyes do not show her pupils their pupils the only sounds that come from her mouth are feral screams she was tied to a hospital bed hand and foot after attacking two of the nurses one was left with severe injuries she does not recognize anyone not even me the most potent sedatives we administer do not do nothing to calm her I know what they did to her but I will not stop until I find the Cure and those responsible for for this evil Act of punishment that's still doesn't get me anymore why is the room still red nothing here what the what the [ __ ] I haven't found like anything any place is that I could use something right you know that I use somebody look around for like millionth [ __ ] time cuz I'm stupid too stupid [ __ ] game this is the blood of the chosen twins well congrats your [ __ ] l so hold up this is here for a reason what if I do this that doesn't count for the rest hundreds of that that sounds terrifying [ __ ] you father father you tell I'm getting a bit annoyed just a bit thankfully it's not too bad uh oh what the [ __ ] thank you for allowing us to interview you director Bertram Walberg we are very aware that this particular delicate time for you and the people of winter Lake do you have any information about how the fire began experts are working hard to find the answer unfortunately we're still waiting to discover the cause what will happen now that the hospital is completely lost as director of the hospital and someone grateful for everything in life has given me I'm currently working on accommodating the hospital's needs with within my Mansion this of course will be temporary at least until we managed to construct a new hospital building I also have I have also spoken to kind donators who will be providing equipment to Furniture how generous of you director I am merely God servant will God serent I will I exist to do his will oh that's going to yep close one close one maybe I should just kill him are you okay get [ __ ] just and look around a bit more now probably nothing here though oh there's some El Maria insisted on having a huge celebration for our little girl's fifth birthday even my stubborn father joined us it appears the girls have changed him in a good way everything would have been perfect if it were not for Noah Maria's father this cold stare makes the girls UNC un comfortable way he treats Maria makes me uncomfortable the old man thinks he can keep abusing his my wife as he did when she was a child or dares believe he can do the same thing with his granddaughters he is mistaken I will protect my wife and daughters from anyone who would seek to do them harm I think that's it yeah um I really said I had to go to the operating room but I wouldn't know what to do there there really nothing I can do there is a light switch there that only works for this room cuz over here it probably has light again or it never had light here so that door will just Loop me around back to the hallway can't do anything here I don't have any new items so going back wouldn't make sense there's some [ __ ] text here nothing what the [ __ ] this is that little little yeah disinfectant room wasn't really anything here I think I checked a million [ __ ] times all right go into the hallway in here that is the dressing room that leads back to the hallway then we have this [ __ ] that's being annoying no that's a shame this leads back to that hallway B oh wow wait I could take this out again I think I don't know if I need it wait how about that door hold up this Powers two doors did you find your ey no not my eye sadly did you oh oh oh oh okay so yes where does this lead again yeah safe room okay so if I take that out the elevator might still work but okay what do I do what would I do with a screw like where would I use is that I don't think I need a screw right now this is where the the oh my God I'm I just keep on being stuck here dude this really is one of those those never ending puzzle games which is fun but if it's puzzle after puzzle after puzzle after puzzle after puzzle then it kind of gets tedious as [ __ ] look I can't do anything anywhere it's horrible I am missing something and I'm think I'm just going to going to leave it at this for today and um watch some [ __ ] Netflix look I shouldn't save right maybe I should just maybe I should save because I did kill a lot of [ __ ] I'm just going to save I'm just going to do it I'm just going to save and then I'm going to go a bit early well we still did more than 4 hours so I mean you know that's not bad tomorrow's Friday tomorrow we'll do a 12h hour then Saturday I think I'm taking a little day off just you know might be smart how do I go back to that dressing room that's the dressing room no that's the operating [Music] room here I think tomorrow we'll just start with um with this game and then after we finish this we'll do um we'll spin the wheel but we're not going to play the next game we're going to do some um some demos some next Fest demos and then we'll probably still have time left to uh to play the next game save in here and then um I'll bust my head open again tomorrow because I am this hurts my head swear to God it might be a little bit of a waste though doesn't matter I still have one left we'll be fine all right till tomorrow back to tormented Souls um let two already left oh I know where I left off I was stuck to the balls here right all right okay so we left off at the operation room and I didn't know where to go well I have good news um I don't have good news I still don't know where to go I still don't know where to go I have been thinking about it though but I don't think cuz we don't have new items right now and trust me I've tried these everywhere I think it has to be somewhere over here right there must be something in this area I just don't know what wait I never went live on Tik Tok what am I [Music] doing there we go yo are again hi kind of boring I had a serious thought when you speak in a higher [ __ ] you sound just like Kermit really do I oh I got to do something with that good to see you kind of boring hope work is okay Aron did you know that it's not evening oh [ __ ] I forgot about that it's actually afternoon so weird so weird all right uh there's nothing here there really isn't anything okay am I going to just walk around in 500 circles till I find something like I swear

operational someone was living here I hear an enemy thank God couldn't even see him but he's dead it's a bit dark here oh God is that going to be a puzzle I don't know maybe can't do anything fair thing here what's that sound oh okay that's not good this kind of sucks because if I grab my shotgun I don't have a light and if you're in the light uh if you don't have light around you you'll die that's nice guess I just waited to come over here come [Applause] here if it ever will I don't know about that just carefully walk yo peasy yeah I'm not sure if I'm ready for 12 hours it's been a

but I must be strong for the both of us Maria's condition wors since by the day her body may be damaged it is her mind that worries me most she says not a word and her eyes have stopped reacting when exposed to light she no longer recognizes me and startles when I try to draw clothes often times she is so disoriented that she screams and breaks everything in her path I can stop her only with an injection I know that Maria My Maria is somewhere inside a damaged body she worsens today I witnessed an awful sight uh as I entered the room she stood in a pool of blood lashing her own back with a whip I grabbed her by the wrist she fought back while screaming at the top of her lungs uh I called in a paramedic to help date her and to put stitches across her entire back how could she do this to herself what goes on inside her head at least tonight she will s sleep soundly by god what have I done Maria will you ever forgive me that uh does not sound good all right let's see if I can go in here I can housekeeping is that like a portable toilet oh what the [ __ ] what the okay something underneath the floorboards here okay this is scary what am I hearing something in this Locker this what am I hearing small metal dial symbols around the edge okay hi little L SE hand and toilet bow oh that's normal how you doing L what's it like streaming with natural light outside whoa a body a body was H me inside okay well that's what I heard um where was I I was what's it like streaming with natural light outside um it doesn't feel natural oh nice a bit sick I hear a lot of people being sick again I hope you feel better soon Muses thr her so much yesterday it sucks just like there's two different things the body and okay never mind I've been watching The Fall of the House of Usher till I think about around like 5:00 a.m. so why like hardcore slept in [ __ ] and I was almost late to my own stream [Laughter] almost double kill baby double kill I really enjoyed this game oh yeah I did I do too apparently I did quit this game when I first play it because I died and it put me back really far same thing happened yesterday but I don't know if you learned how to deal with that it's actually a really good game two twin babies Miriam Mor is set in the process of delivery gives birth to her first baby Noah but unfortunately the other twin met metus met the sale okay I don't know passed away as soon as the umbilical Court was cut at the moment the causes of his untimely death are unknown we hope the autopsy will give us some answers my thr is all messed up ah the game is uh tormented Souls D on Tik Tok as many times as I could yeah I should save pretty soon but I only have one more tape left and it feels weird to save now there's nothing here I'll be fine probably jinxed it now so far it's it's a really good game um yeah let's not do that we need a power room or something oh oh I know where I am I'm back in the main hall okay I guess we should save now I guess now's the time let me try this okay that's not it probably for like a keypad kind of thing uh I didn't stay to see if you checked the game out I suggested um it's on the wheel still I think yeah that's not a CO forgot the name of it but I put it on the wheel and it it hasn't come uh come around yet but I did check it out yes it looks scary so it's on there I don't know what just happened there was a dead creature lying on an operating table it had blades for hands did after circling the body three times it Rose and tried to kill me how was I supposed to know that that was so weird I I found an old scalpel the priest told me it would have been used in the basement morg I should find some leads about the girls there I'm so glad it at least started twitching and then I just tried everything and apparently it was circling around it three times that that worked because if I went the other side it would stop twitching again so I went the other side and then it woke up it's that that was the weirdest it's probably in a note [Music] somewhere oh [ __ ] what do I do with this hold up I kind of want to go back cuz I feel like I still miss a lot there I'm going to have to start thinking where to use that old thingy in here maybe wait what oh this one oh the H with a candle guy walking around oh Jesus okay that makes sense actually that actually makes sense where's the is this the hint like you got to go to the generator room I think it is so I have to go all the way back to the generator room turn it off I'm just going to assume that's it all the way back it's not that far is it you're [ __ ] creepy I swear to God like you're worse than Chucky uh [Music] okay there's another door in the maternity W have I haven't been here what the [ __ ] I haven't I we got to go down there right so wait let me check that is another a door there oh yeah but it's blocked off okay all right there no there's one see that that that yeah that that must be it that must be it can I put you in there probably not it doesn't really have this slot do not run well I don't really have an option to walk do I oh I do okay all right to police so turn this [ __ ] off can I even get through some doors here now I'll see [Music] um this way I'm suddenly thinking what I'm going to have for dinner tonight yeah still dark everywhere so that was probably it this way yay I'm so smart smart oh now I can go back and turn the electricity back on can't I fugitive patience patient with the initials HBP has disappeared he was at the hospital recovering from a self-inflicted gunshot to the stomach to avoid Jil time event happened just after a fifth body was I'm ready tired man only 11 and 1 half hours to go uh just after a fifth body was discovered on his property police are continuing to search for The Fugitive in what immediate area around the hospital this the first case where uh uh I can't say that word no no word a murder suspect has managed to escape these facilities until now the police have been unable to locate any suspects who escape on previous occasions great yeah I'm going for 12 hours today from 3 till 3 so we got a lot going on we got we're definitely finishing this game within 12 hours I assume then we have uh some horror demos that that I definitely want to check out I've been here and then we spin the wheel again which ones um I have six of them installed let me check real quick steam so for now I have the Sleep Experiment fine Arbor mad house Madness all in your head while we wait and Hollow cocoon I can always install more there there's a lot of them but these looks pretty scary oh God it's another one one two yeah I have these these are all games I hadn't heard about ear earlier either so really curious should I go back to the generator and just turn it back on CU I don't trust it I'm going to do that I'm going to do that is this yeah okay I'm going to do that it's too scary okay we we need light uh wait did I ever pick this up yes I know I picked it up but didn't not I Was Made thinking maybe I died after or something I don't know it's a lot of walking around um yes I don't even need a map anymore hold up by the way [Music] okay well can I just push the button I I assume I can yeah let there be lights much better much better wrong way you know I'm really glad that at least these enemies stay dead because I really hate those [ __ ] games where you kill enemies but when you return 5 minutes later they're just they found uh the meaning of life again and they're they're back under their feed and ready to eat you you know the these enemies at least adhere to the like the laws of nature and just stay the [ __ ] down after eating a shotgun bullet I I like that okay let me think this way to to the left this way now we can just cross there we go watch this room be dark anyway yeah see [ __ ] hell okay not as dark scary as [ __ ] dude blood is seeping out of the door I'm not going to open it are you sure oh oh oh oh okay what the [ __ ] okay Secrets experiment room this can't be good sit which he already did because he's in a wheelchair but you know what is it with the calendars does this technically count as a hate crime yes but in game so it's fine I think uh the words have woren away I can't read them okay [Laughter] what there's like one two three four five like six buttons on it and I just happened to press the right one right away did that really happen I've located my father's secret Laboratories uh they were hidden behind a secret passage in the mor experiments are working I was able to replicate Maria's condition by injecting her blood into a dying man from a hospital okay I declared him dead on a medical report no one uh no one will knowe his passing he has begun to show the first symtom everything goes as planned I will be able to administer the first antidote before long ventured into the forest searching for something anything that could lead to my little girls but as usual I found nothing at dawn I returned to the mansion it stood paralyzed in front of the door that was once theirs I cannot find the strength inside me to open it genuinely believe that if I open that door and do not see them inside sleeping soundly I will not be able to keep on living test number 25 showed promising results but only for for a moment after five minutes uh the subject um dissolved into a pool of blood nevertheless I'm not discouraged after 5 years of experimentation I have ereal dysfunction that's weird dick thank God that works today could flowers have been placed on top appears they passed during a medical procedure my god get messed up got to go deeper somebody died behind his bars a long time ago God it was a young child oh he's in prison for a reason [ __ ] yes let's listen to it let's lock the lock no oh wait the asset oh wow we can finally use it it will take days to have an effect okay I guess we wait oh oh my [Music] God you dead you're not shoot it oh my god dude holy [ __ ] I don't

there's another door here though I haven't checked out yet probably closed I haven't been here either what the [ __ ] there's so many ways to go I would love a little safe tape though this leads to the oh wow okay that is a huge shortcut oh [ __ ] I could have I didn't really have to go all the way back to go to the generator I would have unlocked this door and I could just turn it back on there whatever where does this lead the meeting room oh oh I see oh that's good okay wow I love how it's all connected it's really nice all right let's watch the tape was about to say of course it [Music] fits not so close to the screen you'll get square eyes oh what the [ __ ] yeah that's normal trouble to the Past [ __ ] no boss fight please no boss F body was undergoing a medical procedure in a

disappointment I felt when I had let her go wasn't until much later uh I was able to scream into the wind doesn't [Music] work have you guys already seen um House of the fall of Usher by the way because I kind of hate that I can't finish watching it today it's so good especially if you love Edgar Allen Paul inspired stuff then this is this is it it's a Netflix show The House of the fall of Usher it's um yeah it's by the creator of um Haunting of Hill House and blind Manor Mike Flan again and it's really good it's uh it's based on the poems of uh yeah midnight mass right it's based on the poems of Edgar Edgar eleno and although it's not as gory but still gory I guess uh it's it's really well done it's like Loosely based on them now the experiments have keep uh keep failing all the fetuses are misshapen I have an idea that will allow us to obtain more test subjects and accelerate the process but to do it I will have to do something terrible and innocent lives will be lost I have faith that God will give us the necessary strength to complete our mission no matter the cost our goal is sacret once again we have filled the test subject lost her babies prematurely for the third time apparently the placenta rejects fetuses after the second month of gestation Maria suspects nothing yet but I am sure how many more times we can implant her with fertilized a consecutive miscar just have fairly compromised her mental well-being yeah no [ __ ] looking forward to finding some time to watch it yeah I'm really lucky I have uh days off but I'm still making it myself super busy so I was like maybe I should just keep the entire show um for my flight to uh Vegas you know then my flight will be over in in no time but I couldn't wait I can't wait I have to see this I've been

I go back to the present what have you done to the lock Miss I poured some acid on it the metal will eventually dissolve but it will take some time I only hope that the acid Works fast there's almost no candle left I can find you have to be patient little one sooner or later the lock will fall apart for now the best we can do is wait I'm just going to leave her now like thank you miss you just got

meeting room just got to get out here [Music] no yes is it here oh man I I suck at reading Maps apparently this way and we're out the corner yeah yeah yeah yeah here we safe here um tap [Music] use what after going through that strange projection I found myself in a place I'm sure I have been before but it was different I discovered something terrible a young girl locked in a Cell who could do such a horrible thing to a child there is a robust lock holding the cell door I don't think I'll be able to locate the key so I should find another way to open it I have to get her out of there all right let's see if I change the the past if I mess with the space time Contin all right [Music] um back to the examination room this here experiment room whatever yeah see now it's open so she did escape and there's a diary entry now something very odd happened a woman holding a lighter a bright in my prison appeared from The Darkness at first I was afraid but her features remind me of mother she came close to me and told me that she would help me get out of here and she poured acid on her cell door lock she showed me the picture of that father took of Emma and me a couple of days ago told me she received it in the meal more than a week ago after that she left with the promise of returning the asset work the woman the woman was right I just needed to wait luckily the suited man have not arrived yet I'll find a place to hide until father returns from the strip oh oh okay well we can why not I just don't know where to use this just yet nothing else no um where I'm going where where do I have to use that key trying to think oh my God where am I um yeah I really don't know let's go this way is it's not going to be dies locks right [ __ ] it is it won't turn aliens Egyptians and bees aliens and planets Egyptians with pyramids and bees they sting oh [ __ ] know Honeycombs that would make makes sense [Music] right stars or aliens ah wow oh my God okay Jesus so it is these doors or that opens up a whole lot then damn dude all right Maria's lost another child this is the third I do not know how to find the strength not falter but I read this I swear to God I did same thing I already [Music] read and trails have been placed on weighing skills okay I don't remember where there's a little lift I think somewhere can be used with an electric Lance what the [ __ ] all right well we don't have an electric Lance yet okay so we need to find that little lift that needed a battery I just can't remember also there's more doors like these let got to find out place okay first I'm going to check the other door cuz I know where another one is um at least I think yeah here okay um no clue what to do here um okay like cutout so like a square triangle yeah star maybe but like they have to fit in there you know that that explains the tetris like it has to fit in so if you can fit a square in this you can fit a triangle in there and St in in there is it the star now we'll see that wasn't too bad got him um shun shells always nice always nice oh my God perfect so so nice to find those okay I'm going to get a little screenshot of this let F open Action Center open there we go what is that where it came from oh reception oh [ __ ] um [Music] oh wait what was it again like 12:35 one of the letters hold [Music] up this is going to suck 1963 [Music] going to try some stuff but um I don't think I can do this [Music] yet what's the date again like 712 or something we found [ __ ] god what is this oh oh oh okay so it is the last one is two two three the last one is two [ __ ] new receptionist told me no matter how hard he tries he cannot unlock the cas G it looks like can get open his Dr Shawn Meer has been missing for the last week I checked personal belongings couldn't find anything more than a piece of paper under their desk [ __ ] all right [ __ ] we only have two numbers and one of them isn't even in here [ __ ] where is [Music] it oh [ __ ] which one is it [Music] the oh come on did I not pick it up I did which one is it [ __ ] wait 1134 that's not [Music] it um I can't believe I just lost it really not the maintenance lock book it is okay so let me open paint and let me make a screenshot of this this is annoying no no no the other pants we have so this is what we have so the last one is two and then down is three [Music] no you're right I see it last one isn't to okay hold up can we play with this somehow overlap um one okay so the last one might be make sense you think you remember can figure this [Music] out can I though [Laughter] is it is there more than this or is this what I just have to deal with this can solve the puzzle right this is all I need where is there more this G solve the okay [ __ ] so what I'm thinking is if you flip this a bit you can fit this into a square so maybe that's four maybe that's three inside a square and the square is just going to be one or it's just three but I don't get the first one [Music] should I give a tip yes because um my brain is in error look at the lines yeah that's I'm trying to do but um hold up let me think [Music] here this this in one two wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait one two one two one what how does how does this dot I guess the dot kind of decides [Music] oh I'm [ __ ] stupid okay I think I see it yeah oh my God I see it okay the dot does decide so zero one 1 2 3 4 One One 2 three one one two 3 um I think that's right so 0413 140 0414 four because okay the dot doesn't touch any line here over here it touches four lines here one line and there are four lines again so it's no [ __ ] 0 4 1 oh wow okay thank you okay Jesus Christ I got a [Music] coin oh I know what to do with the coin um where was that there's nothing else right hold up let me double check uh the coin there was a fending machine I think it's closed by oh okay that uh that was actually a fun puzzle [Music] here [Music] more [Music] [ __ ] God damn it uh by the way let me um [ __ ] out my [ __ ] on Instagram I completely forgot I was going to do that um me do that real quick tormented Souls picture [Music] somewhere this is like the the the Ocarina game in um Aina of time

do some gambling I'm going to Blackjack off can't go past here cuz there's no lights [Applause] soku I'm just afraid I have a bit too many plants in Vagas yeah I'm going all alone I'm going solo I'm probably going to meet I'll meet some people in uh a twitch con most likely I'm too scared I must say it's it's my first like trip alone out of this country and um my anxiety does go through the roof but I'm also very excited so we'll be fine where the [ __ ] do I go I mean I am used to going to concerts and stuff alone so that that I do a lot alone but like a full trip to Vegas alone that that is still considered scary to me but I mean twitchcon is there when we were young Festival I'm I'll meet people usually at concerts I just do my own thing do I yeah um I went to night wish and there I just met people that I was with all night there was when I still smoke cigarettes so that that way is so easy to meet people but mostly I just do my own thing I like going uh concerts alone I can just stand front row dive into the pit stand on the other side again dive in the pit go go somewhere else I it's so nice you don't have to account with for anyone I'm meeting people uh not really there's one uh dude from Sean's chat that's also going to Twitch gon and I think I'm meeting him for a bit but I am I'm so stacked with plans it's it's it's insane like okay so at like around 100: p.m. I'm still missing oh the hammer okay 1 p.m. my time here I I'm taking a plane to Vegas that's a 10hour [ __ ] flight then I'll arrive there around 2:00 p.m. my checkin at the hotel is at 3:00 p.m. then I have from till 3: to around 6 to maybe get a little sleep in or or not or actually um I could pick up my twitchcon badge early maybe then at 7:00 p.m. I have a concert in the House of Blues from um duware produ uh Fit For A King landmarks and corts then after that there is a party I can go to but I'm not sure if I'm going to have energy for that then on Friday um on Friday is Twitch gone so I have twitch gone all day and then my Friday evening I want to keep it um free because there might be a secret show from Green Day happening um let me show you guys what Green Day posted there there's a sun41 show but it's sold out and it's super expensive so I'm probably not going to do that but Green Day's Twitter posted this so that's going to be a secret show and I think that's on the Friday so I'm going to keep my Friday off um if I can't make it to the Green Day show I'm just going to go to fman Street I think and there there's an open bar Friday evening from 11: to 1 um then Saturday is the When We Were Young Festival ER I don't know how I'm going to get back from the fast from the festival because I can't walk to my hotel cuz there's like a [ __ ] highway in between and you can go underneath but that's apparently a dangerous site so I reserved an Uber but apparently that's not really going to work either so I'm probably going to have to off the party somewhere I don't think I have a choice so I might go to emo night after the the FES of fall which is emo night Brooklyn and the Brooklyn bll then on Sunday I also have IMO Knight and brocklyn B and twitchcon again then on Monday I have the punk rock museum and uh and the sphere I think let me check I don't even know man they have so so many plans wait wait wait wait I I'm missing something too no not maps calendar I'm missing something too hold up yeah okay so on Sunday after twitch gon I'm going to a dying wish show at a very small venue that only fits about 200 people so really excited for that and then in the evening after that show I'm going to emo night Brooklyn again then on Monday I have the sphere experience then on Tuesday I have uh a guided tour through the punk rock museum by the guitar player from some 41 so that's pretty cool and then that's it like I don't have any plans till Thursday so I'm just going to go check out the strip I guess can I please oh yeah okay we got to read this the Monkey Thief the judge read the sentence aloud in an unwavering voice so beak no it's bad speak his fingertips sliding rapidly over the small bumps that cover the surface of his paper I think he's blind so [Music] see the defense attorney seemed hypnotized with an angry Movement by the judges lips speak again accuse mothers wrote in capital letters frantically on a slip of paper and she lifted over her head in desperation I don't know about that victim resigned full blade never fall onto the innocent's neck I don't really know oh the innocent's neck so the last one is uh no head [Music] that's not it okay the second one is the blind about this fix no all right well this ain't easy I want to read it again the judge read the sensus loud in an unwavering voice so speak no evil right fingertips sliding rapidly over the small bumps so that is C hypnotized but angry movements so that is the watchful one I [Music] guess [Music] so evil I don't get it judge rep the sentus allow an unwavering voice his fingertips sliding rapidly over the more bombs okay so maybe this is all in one so this would be C seems hypnotized by the angry movements of the lips so he doesn't hear anything let see here roote and capital letters so she isn't speaking then you hit the gaffle and then the one doesn't have a hat so maybe it is like that what did I say I said oh [ __ ] see oh [ __ ] uh and then it's not listening and uh not speaking and and one lost his head oh [ __ ] yes let's go what the a staple gun power is adjustable okay I guess that we use this to staple his arm on but I don't see any other use for this now [ __ ] all right now what cheese cheese um this game is not easy we still got to use the battery too by the [Music] way man there's nothing I can do I need an arm okay let's oh

then I still have to find where the [ __ ] to use it but that's later concerned I can freeze something in here if I ever need to wouldn't know what this is blocked off that's going to be it for now something very strange is happening here father I don't know exactly what but something is definitely not remember playing this game all say [ __ ] gots weird I've been here before and yet I feel like I don't belong here that's a familiar feeling when you arrive at a new place give it some time everything this game is already like pretty gross that's so good it's just it really there's so much thinking involved like Jesus man my head is raw yeah that's the way I like it all right um okay okay okay okay Chapel is downstairs right where's that one I haven't eaten enough I had a sandwich that should be enough right wait is tomorrow your birthday no tomorrow is not your birthday Monday is your birthday right Sunday I knew that what I think it's wrong in my calendar then no it's not okay

who does that oh hold up oh hold up so TAA you played this game right do you know where the little lift was where you can use the battery there was like a little I think it was a lift I just can't find it anymore I have no idea where it was it's not here laundry room let me think so through the [Music] studio hi The Green Door I I don't really remember I remember walking past like something where you can fit the battery in yesterday I haven't seen it today I confus the [ __ ] out of me here no what the [ __ ] I'm so confused I'm trying to think and play the game doesn't work doesn't [Music] work I'm so confused I'm in the chapel oh here which room do you want to get into now see that's something I don't really know all I know is items I have and I know I can I can use this somewhere this battery I just don't remember where that was little elevator I think so hold up through here maybe it's the laundry room I don't know let's go to the laundry room I can save here too I think so we're definitely going to do that boom we haven't been here today well we have we have [Music] need to go into the shower room hold up I came out of where does this lead public restroom I think it's going to be here oh this that that's the that's an actual El elevator that's um that's not it rest room so around the corner up past the studio this is Studio fast it should be a little door here that is locked all right and I can't go here this [ __ ] is here and there's no light yeah the backtracking does get a little weird okay so I can't get into the shower [Music] room and I can't get into the laundry room so it wasn't there it wasn't there so it is not on this side what about the second floor it wasn't anywhere here it's not here oh it's on the east site somewhere we're go we're going back to the east side kitchens and dining areas could be I was thinking more of like a SP little construction area or something I don't know um they know they know know I'm pretty sure it's not on this side of the area probably the other side [Music] East one fation room no it's not [Music] here I think it's upstairs it's a B I think it I think you mean without a d like as in the Dutch word it's like the inner city so like in the middle of a city like like in Amsterdam it would be like you know where all the canals are and stuff why do I not remember this these yeah I do remember this if I don't the pla you're looking for an apartment in otherlands yeah so like in the inner city it's obviously going to be a bit more expensive this is it this is what I was looking for this is it honestly I am right now with my parents again and haven't been looking so I don't know what what what is a good site right now cuz I'm just spending money right now and I'm going to Vagas next week and after Vegas I'll be looking for my own apartment again now I'm not giving a [ __ ] too expensive I'm finding this little room here I thank [ __ ] I found it it was the library yep there's one [Applause] I think hold up there there was a website that someone at work mentioned I think it's rent bird could be wrong I don't know I never I haven't checked it yet I might be wrong a metal disc with a handle oh I know where to put that 4K for a couple enough to live comfortably yeah yeah that should be fine so the thing like I I'm single as [ __ ] so I got to find something for just me now that's where the issue lies that's the tough part 2K per person that's nice congrats that's good like I don't really make bad money but um still not enough is there really nothing else here yeah it always depends on where you are looking but honestly with 4K it should be fine right not for buying something in Amsterdam dber in over that that should be fine everyone has eights why is that stuck in my head okay whatever I have the the thingy mingy um with the thingy mingy I can hold up let me let me if I ever have to get back here I'm in the library right yes I have to go back to the main hall somehow I don't know where I am I'm just going to walk around and [Music] hope this way who knows who [ __ ] knows just just go places honestly I wouldn't really mind living in tilberg I I guess but you know my family is here and my work is [Music] here I want to live somewhere in between Amsterdam and tilberg so I can go each side for concerts but that would be perfect that would be utre but utre is also [ __ ] expensive [ __ ] hate this country um down yeah that would be the probably the only reason the concert venue do I living in Poland I haven't tried yet but I uh can only imagine so it goes like this this to the top three on the bottom right bottom bottom single this doesn't make sense it does make sense it's mirrored mirrored having issues here close close close ask Nano to live as her attic Goblin I miss Nano I apt her yesterday cuz I haven't talked to her in so long and I don't even know why so I'll ask her there we go that was it [ __ ] now I still need this oh my God this game is not easy [ __ ] me [Music] [Music] wrong way all um let me think rird is paid to win oh yeah the the that's just something I heard about at work I think one of my colleagues got his house food that all right yeah there we go yeah that sounds so [ __ ] so you basically got to pay rent to find a place you can pay rent for okay I want to go back to um that place with the mannequin arm where was [Music] that so I really feel like I'm missing something there if they this all doesn't get me anywhere then I have to go back there I don't remember where that was [ __ ] dining [Music] room was it the dining room door look that place with the mirror what the [ __ ] man this this game is so tough like this this Mansion might be a a tad bit too big [Music] this the dining okay then we went here yeah that was definitely not it like you go places but the hard thing is to remember where the [ __ ] that was shouldn't have left that place wow that came out of nowhere sorry yo what's up canoli how you doing was it it wasn't here it wasn't it was here the Intensive Care Corridor yes that is West too find sound in my ears I'm glad I'm glad I was pretty proud of that one penis um um torment Souls is going but progressing very slowly I'm having issues man this game is uh it's quite [Music] tough West F2 dressing room yes okay I remember repeats a fair bit I just hate navigating through this house forgetting to save and death that's true that's true that definitely happens okay so I'm probably I'm just missing something here I have to miss something here like he's lost an arm he's lost an arm I've been streaming for 3 hours Jesus that in here that that 12 hour stream is going to get might actually be a bit easy shall we make it like a 14-hour stream if I reach a certain like 200 Subs 200 you know yeah I think that's fair 2 hours of [Music] streaming I can probably staple something make it a 24hour I don't think I can don't want to Tire myself out too much before fagas too 12 hours is probably going to be a bit easy so I might just keep on streaming tonight I don't know no no I don't know see this I can't Fu you're kidding me I can just open this not with that [ __ ] [Applause] attitude I didn't take that no I thought I was literally using my scalpel on this I thought oh [ __ ] I can't open [Applause] it [ __ ] me this is why these kind of games take me forever all right look now I can just [ __ ] use that and I probably have to staple it shut beautiful you need some blood too or nothing else there we go Minecraft chest destroyed it the Dutch man yep that is the title of this part on YouTube nice arm father are you okay Carolyn my child that thing has stolen my Bible I'm not your Bible stay there father right now it's vital that you keep calm yes you're right I don't know how I'll be able to thank you for taking care of my arm my child I yeah I thought I'd lend you a hand you know what are you talking about father it wasn't me

will be of help God be an electrical lamp with a power switch cool combine with a shotgun combine with the nail gun combine with combine with I don't know has this game been creepy yet there's been

order something real quick all right food is ordered let's um continue with some games okay so [ __ ] what did he say where can I find do the office second floorng second floor of the East Wing e F2 office office office it's at the end there Corridor Let's uh let's go do that it's a cycle on a bike for a 20 km right like with Uber Eats it's a bit weird because if you like browse around you see different restaurants than if you like search for something specific if you search for something specific a lot of more restaurants that are further away open up where you can and you can also order there like we have something called the Fegan junk food restaurant and although I'm not Fegan that [ __ ] is the [ __ ] best and it's well it's in the inner city and if I browse around you never really see it what the [ __ ] but if I look for it I can actually just order there so you can order from pretty far away okay I don't I'm not going to give a [ __ ] for now through the meeting room to the left this is close how do I get into the office then from the bedroom okay I'm going to need a disc so I'm going to need I think that might actually I think might actually be the floppy is it all oh it is no it isn't guys how do I get a floppy I need a [ __ ] floppy I don't know where to go yeah little is the cheapest so if you have a little around that that's always good we have a little around here and that really saves a lot of money like this is Cola from the little and it's actually really [ __ ] good and it's 2 lit bottles and don't really know how much those sixpacks are nowadays but it's super cheap I don't know where to go I got a [Music] flashlights so wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait I can't really equip it right I can't equip it going to combine it with my jacket or something because if um maybe we can go to the laundry we need light there oh it's on my jacket oh oh oh [ __ ] oh then I can go to the laundry thanks [Music] okay yep it it it's

with the antidote I've injected Maria with the antidote at first the body began compulsing and she released a deafening shriek lasted only a few seconds after which everything went back to silence as she collapsed into bed it was her her skin her hair her eyes looking at me completely loose it when she moved her lips weekly to say something I stepped closer to listen what she said stopped my heart William my father has taken the girls I stepped away perplexed her eyes slowly closed and a pleas smile spread across her face did she wait all this time trapped inside that thing to tell me this her

and crack mother pushes closer and closer to the barrier one of the planks broke and my sister screamed and fell I caught her by the arm it wasn't strong enough to hold her for too long she fell couldn't oh [ __ ] uh I couldn't do anything to stop it mother didn't have any time to react and lost her footing too the men grabbed us and took us to grandfather Noah mother looked worse with each passing second grandfather throw me inside a lock cell told me that no one would hear me no matter how much I screamed he Al said since my sister died I have no use because he needed both of us to open the false entrance after we walked away I was left alone locked inside a cell with a single candle to provide light screamed and cried until I was exhausted may this may be the last I will write

Mansion Found What appears to be a bedroom there's a filthy bed electricity and a functioning television there are boxes of food in the pipe that provides drinking water from above smell was terrible reminding me of the suited man who struck my mother just before she freed us from the metal crosses 7 years have passed since my last entry the television that offers only local channels is one thing that has kept me sane sometimes I wonder why I still hold hold on to life blisters have started to appear on my skin I can feel a burning sensation with each P passing day my appetite diminishes while

nice that everything is dead here so I could have some calm because I cannot apparently I cannot [ __ ] perform under the sound of that [ __ ] enemy sound sucks the stress gets too real okay shining on a ring oh God it's that easy that's I I feel like I've been everywhere with my cursor on that statue okay my my I my thinking was great there like I wanted to go back but I was like no no no no no no no it hasn't been like that all game if if I'm unclear it's at the last position now it was there's your answer members of the sector are getting restless we have fewer twin babies to offer and our attempts to force their conception in test subjects have wholly filled we've only managed to get defective specimen Siamese feed is is that are so misshaped and that they are incapable of surviving long after Cesar an insection this continues I will lose my position as high priest of the poic SE I'm afraid that without my leadership the other members will grow Boulder this might raise suspicions about our cult they said it it's a cult oh [ __ ] off they set the seword [ __ ] go down here I don't know sometimes I dream at night in my dreams the wind dances with a smell of flowers and caresses my face this afternoon sun Paints the clouds behind my M the mountains in sepia and lilac tones my heart fills with joy standing on a beautiful balcony full of plants and flowers all of them full of life I go back inside the room and see the wall covered with Gorgeous green wallpaper the place smells wonderfully of lavender there's a big big mirror in front of me I go to it slowly unable to resist curiosity of my reflection when appears in the glass that's me not exactly person in the reflection has clean treated hair her smooth skin glows with a slight T her lips are red as ripe as fruit uh I admire her for a few moments with nothing but envy and suddenly my chest tightens rage poisons my blood and my eyes turns red and given into the murder Instinct i h myself to the neck of that person that person is so similar to me but whose confused eyes betray her as an impostor I feel the pressure of the blood on her GID artery artery through my fingers her mouth tries to articulate a word push even harder I'm afraid of what you might say so I push some more I wake up in the dark soaking in sweat the sound of sewer water and air curs make me realize that I'm in my room but the laugh Ander snow carries on floating a few moments until Escape completely through the bars did she just kill her twin what the [ __ ] br br there a [ __ ] [ __ ] mace I swear to God millions of ways to go [ __ ] [ __ ] all right I'm going to kill you it's a [ __ ] maze dude storage from oh thank [ __ ] okay let's save 28436 guys oh I'll write that down 284 3 six thank you grandfather Noah came to my prison with a revolver in his hand I turned to him he sted back but the gun but it kept the gun level you're alive he said surprised after all these years you were alive I was stunned was him really him the man who had imprisoned me and left me forgotten all these years I wanted to throw myself at him but then but he had the gun pointing at me and I knew better than anyone the terrible physical condition my imprisonment that put me in this is very fortunate the sign of God he continued I will finally have the Wild Burger twins together once Anna arrives I will finally open the fault and gain access to the temple just a little longer my child just a little longer oh after that he walked out without turning back I followed him to the exit but I suspected he had locked it it's the last thing I will right I've been a prisoner down here all these years but if he thinks he has control over my destiny he is wrong to open the temple entrance he needs a set of twins to offer themselves to retina scanners he needs the two of us Emma and me he will not use my eyes I will stop him the blade is red hot I have to do this Emma if you ever read this do all you can to survive live a normal life forget about me and if you see father do not tell him that I was locked down here all these years uh what I'm about to do to myself I do not want him to see me like that let this be my last decision the final decision I made for myself is she taking her own eyes you see the blood on here oh can't move it how about a little uh doesn't fit it doesn't have to fit okay Emma don't come to the Vault save yourself from hell it's a warning for Emma one of the missing twins it may be possible that one of the girls is inside the Vault I must find a way to get in right I am so saving let's go in Caroline's bedroom what is this my room but this is hundreds of miles away from the Mansion how can this be possible magic welcome to awwards I spoiled the plot of the game guys it's not actually like a hospital uh it's hogwards [Music] happened again last night I had that nightmare the one where falling to the void squeeze my eyesight and an icy cold hits my back when I finally open my eyes I see dirty water running through Stone channels and pipes leading down endless tunnels with Arch ceilings yeah I'm going to have neers about the place too see shadowy human Silhouettes and misshaping hats project onto moldy walls a man in radioactive suit grabs my arm with a gut roll Roar yells let the ritual begin I wake up and drenched in a feeded in a feeded sweat take the sheets of my body and put my feet on the floor only to discover that it is too that it too is wet I turn on the lamp find a room not my own the walls are dirty the window that faces street now the mouth of a dark tunnel where the switch flows I get up numb a stream of P cold air hits me when I look at my reflection in the mirror I see myself dressed in racks my hair dirty and mad confused and scared it is me or so it seems but there is something in her eyes I do not recognize person on the other side of the mirror stretches out her arms and grabs me by the neck you'll left us here I wake up back and my room the light from the street lamps enters through the window silhouetting the leaves of the plants slowly remove my hands from my neck and the TV turns on I pinch myself to make sure that this time I'm awake the dial turns to the right and at times to the left the TV showing seemly random images but always the same am I missing an item again I'm missing a [ __ ] item again don't I closet [ __ ] all right I need a TV dial I need a dial for the for the safe y okay [ __ ] the sewers are huge though so I already assumed that I was going to miss something I had the feeling where does this lead the pumping [Music] room this leads back leads back short CSH thingy is that a kill him oh my God where am I going to find a TV dial [Music] no a lead's back here can you guys tell that I am really [ __ ] done with this game told everyone to watch the how of the fall of Usher and now everyone has finished it but I haven't looks like you're enjoying yourself so much I want to continue I need a TV tile and a safe thingy it must I'm going to assume it's somewhere in the sewers let's think logically I don't have new items at all nothing yeah I got the antidote but that's probably used at the end of the game um it's nothing here cross this that's a shortcut the way back this nothing I see thanks for the raid okay I can't go down here how you doing sir how was your stream have I been here oh oh I got getting [ __ ] here [ __ ] thanks for the rate dude appreciate it we are kind of struggling with this game what's up Saga dog what is that I want it I need to drain the suit [Music] oh now you guys are also in complete stress all right is this an us thing all right I progress all right new stuff this is all because of icy's raid giving me the motivation wrong coures scatter all over um there were mer on the water this whole time okay oh thank [ __ ] Place something in front of the scanner probably an eye oh this is theault this is theault okay so we need the eyes of the the twins eyes of the twins but for now I'm going to masturbate with no um wait young child's Doodles drawn in blood uh I got to go back to that room this place is a [ __ ] maze I swear to God this way maybe dick dick you got coffee [ __ ] a dude a [ __ ] [Music] Sprite all right he turn turned it to the right or something let's try use [ __ ] uh oh god um how do I find that note back my diary um pinch make sure I'm awake the dial turns to the right and at times to the left what maybe I should turn it on yeah okay it's a code [Music] four [Music] where do I need this code for 41 6 9 actually six no six two maybe usually mirror something I'm thinking the same thing but I can't really go back to this room [Music] right let me write this down so that is six or eight [Music] six [Music] three two 632 four oh and then this just [Music] 10 or just [Music] one one or four or five or 10 wait this is six oh I see four five6 yeah it's [Music] six where do I go cuz we already had the code for the safe right we can't do anything with it though Emma it's Emma it's a war May oh this [ __ ] game I swear to God no safe go into the TV but how would I do [Music] that [Music] how would I do that doesn't make sense excuse me I think I'm just going to grab a guide for the last part of the game uh and we'll do a punishment later on next stream or because still need to find a wheel for that or whatever but I'm not having fun anymore I just want to finish this [Music] game 28 oh they do correspond because oh yeah wait there is a to which one is the two I thought it didn't have a to hold up yeah okay well I don't have a note that gives me turning instructions [Music] right it just says turns to the right and at times to the left okay well maybe that is the instruction okay to the right so we have two I haven't [Music] [Music] seen oh really TR to find out by St was really him no yep yeah just show one [Music] Arrow okay so it's two right [Music] four [Music] three oh what the [ __ ] a necklace with a su sign that this was a stupid puzzle [ __ ] stupid [ __ ] what the [ __ ] do I [Music] know got to keep breeding guys okay we shouldn't be mad it's just a game it's just a game it says Emma the [ __ ] can I do with Emma necklace of Emma can I use that for the door maybe no it's not be in the game it's every time you do something stupid you figure out a puzzle somehow same with a TV you just turn it around it's a bit weird and then you find an item and then you're supposed to know what the [ __ ] to do with the item but I think my brain is so right because I've been playing this game for so long now that I just I can't figure out what to do next like I have a [ __ ] necklace now it it's not really ringing any bells at all why the [ __ ] is the safe open or did mirror the safe can I uh open this please now I got this okay this is an but what if I bring this to the The Vault I have enough safes we'll be fine if we save [Music] again what if I bring this to the vault I'm pretty sure I needed an eye though I found a little room in the sewers I can't help but feel that this is the place I've seen in my darkest the stench the cold the dirt the wet it all resembles the horrible nightmares I've been having lately the mirror in this room takes me to my actual room miles away from the hospital I think I know where oh I think I know where to go the big window in my room and had to gather all my willpower not to shatter the mirror behind me open the window and jump out into the yard something inside me knows that this is where I should be I have to help those girls one of them is in the sewers I need to find a way to help I think I know where to go but I have to go all the way out um but there was a shortcut for a reason right I'm just going to try is there there's a shortcut to get out of here right I don't know where anymore but there was there there there's been a few games that that have just completely kicked my ass so far this is game number 16 right I don't want I'm losing count like this is it isn't a bad game but it's really frustrating so it's it's a nice game to just put away for a while and then come back to it you know think about for a while like you know dream about it come back to it with new insights not to [ __ ] play it [ __ ] six hours straight I this is a wild guess but we still needed to do something here and that definitely looks like a Moon it doesn't fit you got to be [ __ ] kidding me oh I got to combine them maybe oh okay okay thank [ __ ] God I didn't forget about this that's normal that's normal find your old hiding place oh ooh oh my head what what's the plot TST going to be she's one of the twins what is this I know this song I know it it's the song my sister and I used to listen to when we were children my sister my sister Anna I remember I am Emma the girl from The Bridge 14 years ago yeah we didn't see that coming did we all this time I've kept the traumatic memories hidden inside my head but this song has set them free it's almost like this would already make complete sense when they had it about eyeballs and stuff you know because Emma cut out cut out her eye and um well if you look at my character she's missing something Anna you have been alone in the dark this whole time I don't know if you were still there but I promise I will do everything in my power to find you it's time to find out what's behind the vault door in the sewers any eyeballs [Music] then mother told us to stay away but we didn't listen we decided to investigate the forest next to the main Garden we were curious when we heard heard hitting and screaming sounds I got scared and asked Emma to go back to the house she insisted on seeing where the noise is coming from she went ahead and I followed within a Glade we discovered three men in full bodysuits they stood under huge rocks carved with symbols and they were using hammers to hit large red stained bag seemed to r one of them poured some liquid over the bag and set it on fire the back started to move with more Force I got scared and snapped The Twig I was holding the man looked in our Direction and we and pointed towards us I took emmma by the wrist and ran we broke through thorny bushes all the time listening to the man's fading shouts finally we made it to the mansion what a pretty dress as moat made me were ruined outbreak yeah forgot to add that you're [Music] right why do I get a nose piercing what have to do with a fishing hook going to fish my eyeball [Music] out see now we get another item and I'm supposed to know what the [ __ ] to do with [Music] it reflect the Mansion making as little noise as possible went to the port down the hill mother was agitated we did read this blisters on the skin yeah we did read [Music] this God now what now what well all [Music] right yeah I don't [ __ ] know what was that that no that's NE what's that what's this videotape of the dentist room okay I guess we're going to the meeting room again holy [ __ ] still a videotape to go does this game ever end okay it's closed though without the officer [Music] that is so loud and I can't turn it off all right so okay this every day the deps just keep patching the game and adding more rooms and key items really feels like that though it's like I'm being monitored like like the deaths are watching I've been watching my playf like okay guys guys he's here we need a patch right now we need a patch right now okay we need to add more bullshits it doesn't matter add a [ __ ] fish hook to it you know what are we going to use the F fish hook for that's later concern doesn't matter let them walk around 600 times I know where this is body appears to have been operated multiple times hello oh this is the spawn area [Music] oh no no no no no this isn't actually it isn't okay scalpel maybe okay thought maybe I had to use the fish hook you take her eyeball out all right guys um this might be gross I don't know that's not bad hold up let me add outbreak before I forget outbreak is not going to be a 1600 hour game right outbreak lost hope lost hope does outbreak give you ammo or do you guys just really hate me my right eye I can't believe I did that to myself okay but now we need your sister's eyeball but you're twins so doesn't matter going I use one of my eyes the eye that's still like in my in my [ __ ] [Music] face don't really know let's go back see if I can find that door be guys it's Friday have you guys do you guys realize that that the weekend is starting do you guys know that cuz I didn't I have [ __ ] three weeks off so I honestly don't even know what day it is most of the time but I just realized it is Friday that's pretty cool pretty bonkers straight ahead I think yeah this way yeah okay so I need to use one eye on here nothing happens uh use the oh my God this is a real thing okay I I guess it makes sense cuz now I can do this and then yeah okay it kind of makes sense but whatever now I need to use this myself no I need another [Music] eye I really can't just put my my face on this no I'm not complete then [ __ ] nice eye oh thank you the scanner is ready have Place something in front of what the [ __ ] what did I do I swear to God I almost walked away I almost walked away TRS in my life open the Falls please end the game end the game then we're going to play some demos if this is it I don't know by father Diagon Alley oh my God told just awkward [Music] a boss fight what am I going to do spit on him now I remember you oh God you have your Memories Back Then you remember that your stupid mother stopped me from sacrificing you and your sister oh a sacrifice that could have brought back our savior well God took care of her he made her pay pay for her sins this is all your fault did you kill my father too never trust the priest the radiation that comes from the sacred placenta is extremely harmful to us impure and worthless beings for years Bertram and his son William after him tried to find a cure for the effects of radiation today William succeeded with this accomplished I have no use for him anymore may God welcome him into his realm you will pay for this Noah what have you done to my sister where is she your sister is just another tool for me to awaken Our Savior such a great voice actor hey wait where do you think you're going I'm walking away to keep out radiation I can feel someone staring at me from the inside ah Maria's escape with the girls I will stay at the temple blocking the door from the inside keep the cult members locked in for as long as possible seven bullets will not be uh will not protect me for long but I will try to make each one count William I do not not ask you to forgive me I do not deserve it but if one of these letters makes it to you I want you to know that I am sorry from the bottom of my rotten soul I am sorry for everything thought we were done [Music] it doesn't fit all right that makes no sense wow okay this finally had a use oh H what the [ __ ] am I supposed to do hold up this is weird I need something in [Music] swear to God swear to [ __ ] God if I miss if I'm missing an item so mad there nowhere I can go right that just leads me back not missing an item that's [ __ ] good like what what does this not make sense I have to open it first maybe I think I remember this it's 12 oh for [ __ ] sake oh come on that doesn't open anymore wait oh I see [ __ ] you [Music] you okay all right I don't know what Terrors I'll face below but if Anna is there I will will find her no matter what can I save here because I swear to God if I die I'm going to [ __ ] flip tables this game never ends dude it's been six months since that damn bir TR closed the fault from the inside hardly recognize myself anymore should have been protected from radiation we were supposed to be the chosen ones what is it mean are we not worthy our suits have served only to delay the blood poisoning Pro say nothing more Prov are secure but at this point I don't think there's any hope for me nope nope there's really no safe Point like [Music] ah oh [Music] game why one of them over [Music] oh I'm dead please let me save Jesus oh my God all right where does this start here I don't know what I'm doing save yesterday I tried pumping gas into a canister but it didn't matter how much I spawn handle not a drop of gas came out even though it was full told the boss what happened and he looked extremely disappointed he grabbed three small handles set way here then he left came back bet with 50 minutes later would have full kind [Music] what whose diary was that Grandpa so that's my diary now we have Anna [Music] complete see I [ __ ] hate this game swear to God started out so good okay I don't even have a gas canister yet so doesn't make sense s oh okay that's a no no oh take that [Music] done it after many field attempts with previous test subjects were were able to bring two healthy twin girls into the world I do not know if we're capable of repeating this fee but this is progress we will wait until subjects turn 10 years old for the sacrifice for now these results have brought at peace to our members children's shoes sacrifices have work very well after being purified with boiling water after go closer to the coming of the creator with each attempt [ __ ] this place just boil me with water I don't care anymore hi hello [Music] oh [ __ ] off got two now hoping that's enough but I don't have a gas canister so what the [ __ ] am I supposed to do um walking away [Music] behind him maybe about 10 hours yeah that could be right I I think I'm oh wow oh wow I think I'm like 10 and a half now YouTube is going to be a bit shorter because I died a few times and I'm going to cut all of that out oh I do have a lot of ammo like I didn't really notice I have so much ammo probably going to need that okay I'm just glad I could save because I could remember everything I fell into the river from the bridge all these years ago did you know Noah is keeping my sister Anna in the underground bunker he is the one who has engineered all of this he has had my sister in captivity all this time I won't let Noah hurt her any longer this ends now excuse me [Music] who let's load because that that is so not worth [Laughter] it Jesus let me past that works I still need a gas canister yeah I'm not done yet there two of these 1 2 3 four five six 7even no I don't think I need all of those but I need a gas canister that's sure [Music] now that I have saved I feel a lot better because I I could just see it happen that I would die and have to do all of it over again and that would really really hurt my soul that would mentally destroy me I think I can kill them but I don't think it's really worth killing these if I can get around them oh wow close my God this place is huge and enemies everywhere sorry for my crying today it's going to be a lot of crying watch the next game be absolute darkg [ __ ] too sto streaming for 5 months got they must have died right here no [ __ ] move it I hope this is enough to do the puzzle cuz I don't know if it is maybe where am I okay excuse me whoa [

you for giving me access to this place I could not have done it by myself but you to take one of your eyes out that was absolutely genius yes I am genius I won't let you use my sister and me for your

basically decides I I can uh I can give you a an explanation after I finish the game of how the how we're doing the challenge how it kind of works what we're doing here after this we are stepping away from The Challenge for a little bit at least maybe the rest of the stream I don't know you know what I'm going to spin the after this if it lands on condemned we're playing that right away if it doesn't land on condemned we are um doing demos for for a bit because it's nextfest and it's always awesome to play those demos so you killed those fools they were not worthy of the polex sect after

ending we got killed by our own sister save only yourself it's a it's a rare one 6% have this [ __ ] this game time for the next one all right okay it wasn't a bad game but I got really really really frustrated with the ending because things just maybe it's my brain that was just fried but things just stopped making sense it it really didn't make sense to me anymore well at the beginning every really made sense puzzles were super fun to solve they were smarts I think this game was really good if it would just last like five hours or something but no not a 10 plus hour puzzle after puzzle after puzzle after puzzle after puzzle kind of game that no wasn't fun for me should have ended three streams ago yeah yeah the D doing it part two and I'm not sure if I really want to play that because I am so happy to get food here so I can finally start having fun all right on to the next game let's see

MICHIGAN REPORT FROM HELL:
game number 15 because we just quit a game we just quit Black Mirror I couldn't get through it the first 30 minutes and I was already done with it so we had to spin the punishment wheel and it's going to be a 12h hour stream on Friday um next game is finally here it's Michigan report from Hell PlayStation 2 title and I think it's the best if I just don't talk too much about this game and just let you guys enjoy the ride okay expect something scary in a different way [Music] um yeah let's just not talk about what to expect too much all right just just let us go in I'm sure you guys will love this cuz it's a really good game basic controls left on look stick move C camera man change camera direction and you can Ram with L2 oh yeah it's It's All Coming Back to Me Now so you're the new cameraman huh yes you're a rookie the name's Brisco I'm the sound guy nice to meet you that's Pamela you've seen her before haven't you she's zaka TV star reporter after all where's Pamela hey you're pretty lucky to be teamed up with Pamela right up the bat but don't go getting any funny ideas about her you hear me I hear you that that's pamel of course Pamela probably wouldn't give you the time of day anyway Whoa man why not what could the agency be thinking I mean sending a newbie like this guy out to get Scoops Scoops huh oops you hear that oh well don't let it bother you it has a beautiful voice acting I'll be teaching you everything you need to know about TV news coverage listen up do exactly as I say there move near Brisco hi of course a cameraman's number one job is to be able to shoot things properly yes like this doesn't get any more basic than that you know what to do right I got to shoot things properly first off try shooting that box there [Music] box this one yes oh okay just an ordinary box hi Brisco I did it fine you should be able to do at least that much if you call yourself a cameraman wait I got to fix something real quick you got to have an eye for Scoops can't just let them pass you by just pointing the camera at things will never get you a scoop you know if you want to scoop you got to get out there and make one and you can't just stand there like a stick you got to move around up high down low you got to shoot the subject from every [Music] angle all right hold up hold [ __ ] around a bit um res solution NOP Yes actually there we go there we go that's what we need all right I completely missed what he said we got to go to Pamela I think yep hi you focus on the reporter and lock on to her oh wait we can shove people right what if we do that to Brisco no idea did you find anything okay next topic ramming is a technique you can use in a pinch I love ramming a cameraman can only use his body you see yeah he can't take his hands off the camera okay try raming into me right now and I remember this was a thing not too hard though you hear no I only Ram hard you ready okay go ahead and try it but take it easy we're just practicing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let me Ram into you go easy now yeah yeah yeah bend over I mean what come on right charge it up let's [Music] go hey you idiot I told you to take it easy beautiful game son of a sorry now only you use ramming in emergencies okay we use ramming in emergencies you'll know when just use your common sense man that hurt look whoever fored Brisco must have been high as [ __ ] he is so slow all right go back to Brisco I'm right here hello so you're the new guy huh yes I'm Pamela Pamela Martell nice to meet you okay Brisco I'm borrowing the new guy until we start shooting was this first time you didn't need to Ram him so hard okay fine it only hurts once but there isn't a whole lot of time you know don't be late for the take it can be tough out here on location we've got to work as a team okay I forgot I forgot I forgot don't mind Brisco he's always like that of course that's just my own personal opinion but what the [ __ ] is happening shooting decision is some movie I was just about to trip over that board I helped her thank you so that's the way you work is it I can tell we're going to get along just fine but if you hadn't warned me about that board you might have gotten a little scoop on me well scoop I guess we'd better head back to the news van um I forgot Tik Tok [Music] how and usually Den fa covers the southwestern area Lake Michigan federal government has advised evacuation of cities in the area including Chicago there's no official word yet on the fox cause [Music] news reporter Pamela [Music] Martel Sean Philipe Brisco Brisco is my is my is my man I love him Al keep Pam alive did I keep her alive last time I do not remember okay wake up time for a scoop get up Scoops baby you ready got your tapes battery okay all right Pamela is standing by outside I killed all of them and leave the sound to [Music] me this is a once in a-lifetime Opportunity let's get it right okay two one good evening everyone this is Pamela marel we report tonight on a strange phenomena an unusually thick fog the cause of which is still unknown has cropped up in the southwestern area of Lake Michigan is not the Silent Hill the entire city is cover think it is someone screamed let's go someone screamed let's go are you all right what happened to you they all got killed what are you talking about what happened it came through the oh my God help me [ __ ] what are you doing run get away from there come on wait let's get back to the news man what was that what's happening just calm down what's going on I'm so glad we're playing this game guys calm down Pamela calm down how do you expect me to calm down it's going to be all right hey what's the matter with you are you just going to stand there filming turn that camera off I tell you don't get mad at him useless idiot I've had it working with losers like you two behind you I'm joining up with some other te what just keep quiet can I help her stop thinking you can order me around huh I can't do anything I think she dies out of way you can you save her because that you can press triangle I've been spamming triangle it it didn't do anything all right well she's [Laughter] dead I don't think I could save her well RP so every time you uh one of them dies a new one pops up basically you get a new uh new [Music] anchor arriv to the International Hotel filling in for Pamela martal new reporter an Anderson oh I remember that I don't know how to do that like I I couldn't move anything skips part of the story line oh I don't know that I think it [Music] does I mean I can try now we have to play the game over again if we I don't know hello finding anybody in that room either what a bloody mess huh yes all right let's give up here there isn't anybody left in the whole hotel the whole hotel looks like it was just a false lead Brisco went downstairs a long time ago and anyway the other teams are getting the jump on us we don't have time to waste hanging around here the voice acting is so great we've got to get out there and find something wait what what is that Green Dot huh the telephone could it be Brisco oh you can lock on to her hello woh hello hello can you hear me I can hear you calm down slow down somebody answer mom mom is that you no no I'm not your mother no no help me she seems so she's so calm hear you very well wait don't hang up you sound like you meant that Center building the observation deck the observation deck of the Center building is there anybody else there with you I don't know but but something is [Music] coming okay okay I've got it just stay right where you are okay we're coming to rescue you you hear me okay I've got it don't give up someone's [ __ ] screaming on the other side of that phone do you understand she hung up no [ __ ] I'd hung up yeah I can't do anything again just an ordinator telephone okay I that was weird there's a survivor in the center building let's go maybe we can get some leads on what's going on but more importantly somebody's in trouble R should be downstairs let's hurry oh my God so slow yeah like I'm I'm trying to figure out how this game works again cuz I think this filming different stuff can give you points or something and it's too much static to tell what's on last month's newspaper the adline say string of disa appearances in Michigan I think that that all gives you points basically bacteria and Extinction fing fre human spread of bacteria oh what was that what was that am I filming my house fruit is starting to rot because you need new fruit that's why clean the blood there's a blood stain here must have been a really gruesome incident yeah it must have been now we just go I guess this game is really strange go press X to go through triangle to go back go through what a guy that Brisco what a guy as soon as he knows he won't be needed takes off huge blood stain here BL split it on the wall pick pools of Blood on the floor what's this Corridor is blocked by a piece of Furniture I don't know if I have to do all of that uhoh don't leave her alone Mrs an Anderson oh good the elevators are still working oh God CU sometimes whoa sometimes the game goes in come on we're going down get in slowmo I don't know why scoop indicator at the top of screen shows what kind of Scoops you've been focusing your attention on the E on the left STS indicates erotic points and ask for suspense yeah I forgot that was a thing you if you do this you get more E points I think who's playing the piano Billy [Music] Joel okay why is the game going in slow mode yeah this is the last old game I'm going to play I think because this doesn't this is such a [ __ ] always to get get it to [Music] work there was something here what Joel too soon too soon okay this is not good um how do I fix that I might have to say goodbye to Tik Tok and see if that works no that doesn't work sorry we're good to go I had to fix some stuff because it was running way too slow and we should get should be good now should be good hello what does what do the colors mean again like green is that she safe the other ones aren't or something is it water a huge spot bought a spider oh rammer [ __ ] saved [Music] you hey what are [Music] you thank you that was close I could have killed her all right could have killed her it's a huge [ __ ] spider okay is it water oh it's water yep it is this game is so weird guys it's so strange let's get back to Brisco like you have to point at things for them to see it or something it's so strange if you look up the price for this game um it's so expensive we found some Brisco here drink I really want it though great thanks think it's like a 200 euro game now I'm a new man okay back to covering the news where to next that was a quick recovery okay there's a survivor in the center building okay got it the van's outside let's go all right's go right I I don't want her to die too like so far so good I think no it's a [Music] monster it's a monster running into moner reporter always has their gun handy so focus on incoming monsters get reported to fire at them smaller going be [ __ ] where are they here shoot of them fire get it see I got to point at the [Music] monsters they can shoot at film it film that thing you guys still safe yeah this is like the crisis of PlayStation 2 get it God there's so many does this ever stop what what a scoop fire I'm not in a crossfire right I did it she's alive guys she's alive I did it you're good you're good is that it that's all I guess the big one got scared and took off damn that wasn't so tough really don't jinx it but let's get out of here before the big guy comes back come on yes let's go Reporter had a [Music] gun zaka TV team log now now I can probably do on the way to the center building in news van hey it's a news van we found crew let's join up with them good idea due to emergency situation we decided better team up with them oops didn't see anybody around the fan though more details later hold up an there isn't anybody inside NOP they're dead no I guess not games where did they go it is working blus I fixed it hey no I didn't kill her now right there's somebody over there huh P

let the reporter take care of the doors okay well calm down fine they're broken we can't get out this way well there's this way there we go yes wow we got in here there's even fog in here it's because the developers were too lazy to fix it creepy they were probably like oh wow [ __ ] the fog is still inside and they were like yeah [ __ ] it let's just make it part of the game it's a feature now office memo please ensure the key is replaced in its original position coffee looks great be nice to take a break right about now huh must be imagining things what where are they oh hi [Music] d d

my God this game is [ __ ] is that what you call a scoop that is what I call a scoop Chrisco what the [ __ ] do I do something with the key in the original spot oop scoop uh what wait reading this note it'd be wise to leave here at once before something terrible happens okay let's go I don't remember what everything means standing on one of those white thingies and that changes color I guess we're not going back what if I just uh yoink what do you think you're doing oh it's so delayed I love it not under the ground here I think last playr I was stuck here too what the hell yeah I think

damn it I don't know if we we've been in that church last time we played this I have no idea I think we did I remember going to a club eventually which was says my name is Jeff is it [Music] start out driving to the main headquarters but Brisco ended up crashing the fan fan was total we were lucky to be alive [ __ ] Brisco after walking around aimlessly in the mountains uh for a while we came across a deserted Campground seeking refu Refugee we headed to the campground one sup there's the lodge we're tired we'd better rest there a while sorry about this if I hadn't crashed the van we could have been at headquarters by now yeah dumbass dick face look somebody's lying there unconscious oh no let's go see but be careful okay I remember this part I remember killing someone here too really fast okay walk slower doesn't look like a monster maybe because it isn't oh my God it's moving are you too what speaks English what are you doing here did Dwight ask you to come Dwight at the office no we had a little car crash we've been wandering around looking for help we just found this place totally by accident new host yep really and you what were you doing there past out H I was supposed to meet Dwight here thinder did but I can't remember anything else huh anyway let's go inside and talk I can't relax out here how did you know we were a zaka TV news team because that's a zaka TV shirt oh Dwight works for zaka TV so I recognized it huh by Dwight do you mean Dwight Murdoch yes that's right do you know him no of course I do he and I go way back he got hired you mean Dwight Murdock do you know him he never told me he had such a cute girlfriend though hey hey nice to me bris the name's Brisco and what about you you never put down that camera do you I'm not allowed they're like glued to this thing that giv be a habit with TV cameram I have to [ __ ] film about it I'm not getting paid enough for this [ __ ] yes I do actually Dwight's the same way so why did you come here didn't you think you should evacuate I heard the evacuation advisory after Dwight had already gone out to cover the story he called me from where he was he couldn't make it back to our apartment so we agreed to meet halfway here at this Lodge and so here I am why were you passed out did you get attacked I don't know maybe the question is who attacked you if he's hanging around here when everybody else is evacuating he must be up to no good doing something he didn't want anybody to see and then you showed up I bet he hit you over the head with a blun hunt instrument so where is this guy now he's probably still somewhere [Music] nearby calm down there's nothing to worry about nah it's just Thunder it's starting to rain so you think this guy is nearby yes I don't know we got to stick together don't worry we're here with you now that's true Brisco is such a such a such a such a player why didn't you try paging him good idea [ __ ] last host Dice and he's already latched onto the next one nope no can do the phone's not working damn it's a horror game so cut off from the outside world h huh [ __ ] boy energy exactly way Nina did you come here by car yes I left it in the parking lot that's why I usually leave cars here's what we'll do then we'll wait for Dwight until it stops raining if he doesn't show up by then we'll take off in your car okay it won't do us any good to hang around here we can contact Dwight from the office anyway DWI from the office okay oh that that sounds reasonable until then a different talking about from the office and try to get our strength back you must be tired too Nina why don't you take a shower or something yes all right oh I guess I will no Brisco [Applause] yes man that shower did me a world of good hus stopped too I guess we'd better head out then go beep I thought I could actually but could you go get the car from the lot sorry but I want to rest a little bit more I feel a little dizzy oh are you all right I'll be fine I just need to rest that's all yes do that are you sure yeah you'd better hurry though all right let's go huh did you hear something upstairs just now somebody up there don't do that don't do that it's [Music] dangerous oh my God it's Brisco 2 know you guys shop at the same shop or oh right same company right no who could have done this um it's probably somewhere close by we can't stay here any longer first go you're right all right I'll go get car maybe we should leave let's go all right so I let her die last time I don't know what to do here we'll see if we can save her this time look here's a shotgun you might not know it to look at me but I'm pretty good with a gun as long as we have this we can feel safe huh Brisco was pretty calm about finding his coworker dead don't you think maybe he's a really cold guy or maybe he's just seen too much he's gotten numb I thought there was going to be a giant monster wait a minute you don't suppose do you think Brisco could be nah he couldn't be what am I thinking I must be getting really tired to have a suspicion like that here it is this is my car come on get in let's get back to the lodge Brisco is waiting for us to tell the truth I still can't believe this is all happening but I guess that's the way it is the bigger things are R starting to look real they actually seem almost like a video game you know I'm sorry I don't even know what I'm saying anymore I think I'm getting tired and confused look here we are that was [Music] fast Brisco Brisco we brought the car back Brisco right yeah wakey wakey Brisco do you still feel dizzy no I'm fine now let's head out what was that huh yeah remember this I don't know what to [Music] do I'll make a safe State shoot it Nina what a scoop what a scoop shotgun seems to be working fire wait what here no no no no no this this wasn't it though right you did it I don't remember that's nothing compared to that bear I time ah that thing wasn't so tough don't let guard down just yet in the movie yink okay maybe that was it God Dam it stupid monster damn it run never mind me what we're not going to leave you I can take this thing just get out of here I'm all right I've still got some bullets left I'll make this thing blow up from inside look out maybe she supposed to die think she might be supposed to die because what the [ __ ] I couldn't do anything next [Music] hey we're just about to arrive at headquarters we never this far without everyone dies everyone dies grateful to her maybe I should look this no that that's considered a guy we might I want to know if you can see so watch [Music] out well well it's Brisco so you're all right huh yeah a lot of stuff happened but we're still alive good to see you're all right too how were things at home everybody must have escaped but Jonesy wasn't there either I'm worried Jonesy our pet rabbit oh okay oh okay well I bet your family took him with them so what about the chief did you already talk to her no I was just about to go in when you two showed up good timing now we can go into together okay fine I guess we might as well good okay now let's really let the chief have it this time we've really got to let her know in no uncertain terms the teams go through hell out there when we're covering the news what are you doing Brisco especially this time come down the government your what are you doing but she sent us out anyway a lot of our colleagues have disappeared you're going to hit yourself in the face with dead like Pamela oh he really lik Pamela I'd like to he doesn't care about anyone but Pam the same thing poor Pamela went through yeah well you know damn straight and you know what else she'd better make damn sure she doesn't go exposing any more of us employees to danger and she'd better let the ones who are left evacuate I'm going to make her promise and you you get it all on tape all right that's my job that's a pretty good idea for you Brisco if you get it on tape even the chief can't try to worm her way out of it like later worm that that triggers PTSD don't don't say that move Brisco what the [ __ ] could have happened here love D has been done yikes monsters oh [ __ ] runs fire oh there shoot it not bad huh proud of you yeah baby you whoever you are yeah baby gosh you're slow Risco you're ruining the a shot god damn it someone fire this guy okay let's go let's look around I see oh sexy beam zaka do TV I don't want to go there oh ooh oh that sounded interesting it's a filing cabinet wow there's many important looking documents what's this oh that's literally a mouse okay I see what you did there a rat no that's a mouse there's a new message on the answering machine seems to be from Robbie Adonis not going to listen to it no okay [ __ ] you what was that for standing in the way so the chief's in there huh okay let's go in all right excuse me I'm Justine rhods hello what's going on what's this disturbance sorry and a camera too sorry this oh my camera's broken oh um we have something very special would like to discuss with you we'd like a pay R do do you well you see hey what's the matter go ahead and tell her yes well speak up now it's your job to communicate isn't it yes you're right come to think of it what do I want to go out of my way to make the chief bad at me for how come you're making me say it you do it hey hold on I don't want the chief mad at me either what are you do Whispering about you're being very rude you know yeah that's Brisco don't mind him oh [ __ ] sorry uh all right fine I'll say it then listen Chief uhoh here it comes let's see your name was Brisco wasn't it yeah yes uh that's right Brisco Risco you know my name wow I'm honored wow you have a reputation for doing fine work out in the field you're the number one candidate for this year's flare award am I really and of course I've been thinking about a suitable promotion for you wow uh thank you very much ma'am wait a minute what happened to all that stuff you were saying oh oh right right of course now listen here Chief yeah seems so manipulative you deliberately ignored the government's evacuation advisory you demanded that the news teams go out and cover stories you unnecessarily put their lives in Jeopardy he's doing the arm thing again I never demanded that the teams do anything just shut up and listen and listen czy arms I John Philip Risco say this as a representative of all zaka TV news news teams we refuse to get kicked around anymore oh this voice is acting I this is fascinating do go on so this is what you're going to do chief find out what happened to every single news team member that disappeared and make sure we all get safely evacuated damn right you're going to do these things and you're going to do them right away going to sh you got that no and you're going to apologize to and compensate the families of the team members who died I want you to promise you're going to do these things right here in front of this camera yeah this camera there's no need for that all those things have already been taken care of oh they have but hey hey wait just a minute show me you're taking this seriously don't delegate these things to your staff I want you to take care of them personally nice cleage yeah thanks thank you let me share something with you 5 hours from now there'll be a military rescue transport at the airport that's the military do you hear me I I hear you I negotiated for this with General Sanders personally you see I see now God this takes so long beginning to understand oh I see a military transport you say well that's great I guess somebody as important as you would have lots of high level connections like that make a camp horror game like this Sunday we should well so Brisco would you like to be on that transport I don't know how I can help but I can probably make a table of course you want to get that's all I can make in blender apparently yes I'll do anything well then I have a little favor to ask I can do the voice acting oh that's going to be fun favor ma'am what is it one of our men is being held in detention in a certain place held in detention what for please don't ask the man's name is Glenn Buckland I believe with the confusion of the evacuation advisory I'm afraid he was Left Behind still locked up oh shut the [ __ ] up can't leave him there now can we me I'd like you to go rescue him okay okay you want to make sure every single employee is all right isn't that what you said well yes [ __ ] yes of course so where is this guy being held in a research room at the von Eric Library a research room in the library research room at the library we'll get him out of there I love brisk always keeps like repeating I'm sure you've realized this could be a big scoop Scoops you know a dramatic rescue scene make sure you get it all on tape and as for your report yes ma'am your work hasn't been quite up to Snuff lately a news reporter has to be PR professional and accurate at all times you know I start yes of course but I don't think her Pro never makes excuses for herself take the chance you're given and get it right locked on there this next report will be your moment of truth yes ma'am I'll do the best job I possibly can you do that very well that would be all yes ma'am thank you yes excuse us well that was pretty disappointing Brisco yeah dumb ass I don't know what happened I couldn't help it it was like I couldn't go against her you know yeah this character is a bit of a bit of a creep not especially at this particular moment in time she just happens to be my boss so what who knows in in 5 years our positions could be reversed like a RSE right man you're really something but never mind that let's get to that Library yes I want to show that mve and what kind of report I can make when I put my mind to it sure sure that took a while now keep been having the feeling it's thur day but it is Wednesday so we still have time tomorrow too for this game that's nice because on Friday we're playing demos for 12 hours actually we're playing more than demos on Friday holy [ __ ] I almost forgot 12 hours [ __ ] so they locked the poor guy up that's going way too far I wonder what for it's simple I bet he got fired what are you talking about that's right I bet they were going to fire him or transfer him or something yeah and then what on the pretext of having him concentrate on Gathering data without being disturbed they shut him up in the library research room during his working hours in other words they were just waiting for him to get fed up with it and quit on his own they do the kind of things those useless guys that just take up space you've seen the type haven't you that's outrageous it can't be helped different people have different levels of ability right but if we don't do a good job on this next report the same thing might happen to us wouldn't want that to happen look we're almost at the library all right let's kill another uh reporter here 3 2 1 good evening everyone this is Justin roads I'm reporting to you now from in front of the von Eric Library our news team has remained behind here in the city still covered in a mysterious fog to bring you the news apparently a according to information we got just recently there's a man still here at this Library who's been shut up for several days in a research room and left behind we are just about to go in and rescue him [Music] ooh we're now here inside the Library I can I can tell there's no sign of anybody around the staff is probably all evacuated already we're now going to try and find the research room where the man is reportedly being held follow the camera this is the scoop okay books this is a checkout desk this is where books would ordinarily be borrowed from the library as you can see there's no one here now no beautiful beautiful you're such a good reporter so good here is a calendar yes a date on it has been circled in red is it a Library holiday what is that the 8th August 8th 199 library's interior is dim you're the worst reporter I've had far row of neat orderly books neat it's deadly quiet here here are stairs that lead to the basement let's go see what it looks like shall we why why would you do that usually this library is a place where many people gather to read and do research today however it's empty yeah such wow you don't see anything that looks [Music] useful well what are you going to do computer I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm looking for honestly it seems to be a teral for looking up books but is it working oh yes it's working there's something on the screen what could it be that's not a book research terminal it's a security camera monitor wa plot twist wow that's crazy yeah wow what appeared at first glance to be a research terminal was actually a surveillance system oh my God this game every room in the library can be observed right here on this monitor how to use a surveillance system left analog stick up and down switch cameras right unlock stick Left Right Move camera fuel think think I remember why we need this because there's something on top of those shelves or something I don't know that's a strange way to arrange the shelves think you can push them I don't know look there's somebody there where there's a man in a small room at the back he has the same f locked in he appears to be afraid of something have books do you know how scary that is oh what the [ __ ] look there's something written on the wall 13 + 9 + 3 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 1 + 14 Michigan e is what oh I see es5 easy done holy FS what's up with that clock it only has an hour hand oh I guess it could use a hand not again where the [ __ ] okay so we can save him think I can move those around or something e is five there there's a key there's something there I heard you need a hand it's really small I can't see it very well that's what she said sorry no no no he didn't he didn't it's not very handy hands off okay can I go back I can you hear me Jesus yes I can this is Justine RH from zaka TV can you hear me don't worry we've come to get you out of there if you can't hear me please answer me need to handle this carefully don't worry we handle this situation it's no use I don't think he can hear me all handsome deck we're you guys need a new word I mean it looks we went through all of them all right guys we got buzzles not really though I don't think it is actually buzzing there's something on top of the shelves yes a key but I can't reach it there's a step l oh [ __ ] you door the Explorer come on oh a step ladder yeah yes it must be for getting down books from up top no [ __ ] if I climb the step ladder I'll see what's on top of the shelves very handy uh step ladder yeah yeah just pull up with your hands she's going to need a hand with that no she can handle it I found a key I wonder where it go goes to what is this books scary it's a note please contact them by Friday it says that the note doesn't look like it will be usedful [Music] you there's a musty smell my name is musty what and Muzzy something sandwiched between the books it's my says where do pirates get their hooks secondhand stores that sound was perfectly timed that that was my reaction to that there's a note sandwich between the books a is 1 X is 24 Y is 25 yeah yeah yeah okay I I'm not stupid draw had the best fun fact second floor looks like let's go and see shall we no I'm curious out of all the species of sharks in existence there's only one that can fart really is it uh the baby shark baby shark or not as you can see the second floor also has book Stacks no [ __ ] it's a library many many books fill the shelves this facts I I want to know uh um chat what shark can fart sharks like other fish do not have a gas- filled swim bladder that allows them to control their buoyancy like some other Aquatic animals as a result they don't have the physiological mechanisms for producing and releasing gas in the same way that some bony fish do which can create the audible fart sounds associated with gas escaping from a swim bladder while sharks do produce gas as a natural byproduct of digestion it is not released in a manner that would create farting sounds instead gases produced during digestion are usually expelled through the shark digestive system in summary sharks do not fart in the way that humans or some other animals do and they do not have swim bladders or similar structures that could lead to audible gas release well that's that's lame there's nothing about the tiger sand Shar here [Music] though um how do I do with this F5 can a tiger sense shark fart it's not working can a tiger sand shark the longest place name in the word at 85 letters not working the talk top is so broken Taho New Zealand locals just call it toata Hill great beautiful information it opened like I want the key bind that I could just press and then talk to you know to chat GPT whenever I want to isn't that can I

whole thing a little too lightly but your words of encouragement have help me to hang in there somehow thank you from you got to read this so fast it's [Music] crazy Bron thanks for the r [Music] sir appreciate it how you doing how was your stream uh no hi Bron how you how you doing thank you um didn't I just check this oh not this there seems to be some kind of note it says the answer to the equation the date on the calendar the arrangement of the bookshelves the Broken Clock wait do I need to remember this so that is the or I already forgot progress Starfield are you liking it I want to play it off Stream So calendar that's nine I think and then the books is probably a three T says another fact people who stay up late at night have more Psychopathic Tendencies than those who sleep

Twitter this is what the wheel did we got a 12-hour stream on Friday because uh we played this game I only played it for like 14 minutes it's called Black Mirror and that [ __ ] was so horrible that I was like I'm not going to do this I'm not going to finish it so whenever we do that we got to spin that wheel um but so far we have finished 14 games and the best one and that's rough because we have

there's too much in Harvester take a very long game if you do everything ordinarily overflowing with great crowds of young people Club GOI is now as you can see completely quiet with a power turned off inside the building we can't film right now with an ordinary camera the images you looking at now are being shot with an infrared camera he will now use his infrared camera to locate and restore power to the building after that we will try to find and talk to the man named Dr OK Conor okay that was good GG you conveyed a real sense of tension there great report thanks forco that was nice of you to say now then it's pitch black Beyond this point so we won't be able to go with you oh you got the infrared so you're the only one who will be able to see anything you call this seeing anything like I can't see [ __ ] main power breaker somewhere in the building you've got to find it okay it's SE bad dude I can't see [ __ ] Swit the breaker on and that ought to restore power to the yeah yeah

now investigate the interior of Club GOI I think I think we are yeah see Club GOI is designed to look like a gigantic prison cell entirely enclosed in steel bars it's rather disconcerting to be inside but these days Club GOI is a popular night spot with a hip young crowd a hip young crowd this is the entrance it doesn't look like anybody will be getting carded today he has to talk about everything this is a gate this is a speaker yeah this is a dance floor this is my middle finger smells like ass cuz I just just scratch my butthole with it I think yeah I think it is it was never a long game anyway right what's up Brisco um pretty sure I have to do something here maybe not yet where's uh where bottles lines the shelves cool oh there you are hello this is a St stage oh wow stage set up for the DJ for the DJ that was in her earlier who um claims he made music for GTA 6 [ __ ] love twitch man [ __ ] special people in this place you want me to film you or okay yes just just just go in here what are you doing oh you're you're going to grab the bottle that's to send it made that rockstar I just I I never know how to react man but it's you know those people always have you know something wrong in the wir ring so you don't want to be too rude but this is the bar as you can see we have a large assortment of liquor wine and beer I'll take all of it I just got my tickets for Vegas with like all the extras I got and I got like free drinks at every single [ __ ] club there and an open bar for two hours where you can drink literally everything oh it's going to be crazy this is where they control the sound throughout the club by using this computerize system okay cool I'm excited for Friday guys 12 hour stream and and lots of demos I dropped a link in Discord where you can see all the horror demos there's like 100 out there and there's some really cool looking ones could that room be on the stage be the I think I remember that I think I remember that you sent me that admitting he's a fake with yeah yeah I remember that um go there team a field there this is a VIP room Only The Chosen Few are allowed to enter club GOI hly is ground one could say there's literally someone in the [ __ ] VIP here inside this room he's right there Dr o Conor are you here oh sorry oh [ __ ] sorry I didn't mean to film that I can't zoom out so it all looks weird now hello Dr o Conor okay he's not really responsive hello game he's here yeah no [ __ ] you're Dr OK Conor aren't you it looks like a doctor what's this who are you people you there turn off that camera I'm Justine rhods from zaka TV Dr o Conor would you allow us to interview you what in the world are you talking about God abely no sense beautiful absolutely amazing Dr oconor we have reason to believe that you know what is behind this mysterious fog what is causing the gruesome monster attacks all over Chicago we want to hear the truth directly from you I have no idea what you're talking about why on Earth are you bothering me this is completely outrageous you were supposed to meet a man named Glenn Buckland here weren't you huh how did you know that did you talk to him why isn't Glenn here Scoops he's dead What Glenn he was killed by a monster [Music] hope be all right d save him but I see and you want to know more about what killed him is that it well so you do know something don't you I'll tell you about it then the monster that killed him is the military the government oh my God I knew it zaka group what are you trying to say that the military the government and zaka group are behind everything that's been going on yep trying to use that brain of yours are you zaka group is a huge Enterprise made up of a parent company and some 1300 subsidiaries did you ever stop to wonder how it got so big that's what she said what don't try to change a subject DNA that's how you just don't listen do you okay okay so what about this DNA I see TV turns even the brains of those who appear on it to Mush you must at least know that zaka group has a patent on its DNA manipulation technology oo if all you can do is judge people on their outward appearance that's sad but I'm sure your tiny brain has never imagined what zaka could do with that technology that's a trouble with Scientists they never just come right out and say things soon you humans won't be enjoying such Superior attitudes anymore now you're just talking nonsense there's definitely something wrong with you all right all right all right all right calm down both of you I'm sorry Dr OK Conor why don't we all have a drink we can talk again after we've had a chance to relax I like that idea why do all of you turn to alcohol in every situation because life usually you hold yourselves in check no I don't but then you use alcohol as a crutch and expect it to solve all of your problems it does isn't it all rather ridiculous besides my body can't process alcohol anymore in the end no matter what I tell you it's not like it'll save you from any what are you like what 25 what is this lunatic talking about you be quiet Brisco Dr o Conor what do you mean by infected the virus um virus what virus Corona virus your head an empty shell as well sometimes the virus is what's behind everything that's been going on here in the city you've seen them haven't you the people being transformed now hold on one minute are you saying people are turning into monsters because of a virus now you're finally beginning to catch odd biological God the dialogue is so slow in this game what in the world could you be thinking so slow making viruses on purpose why would anyone do that isn't it wonderful it's the latest form of bioweapon the enemies are infected by the virus and they turn into monsters and start killing each other its beauty is in its efficiency wouldn't you agree but I'm afraid this virus has been a failure those infected can't be controlled and their sense organs degenerate they display excessive reactions to loud noises which attract them they just don't make good weapons how did the virus get spread all over Chicago I don't know come to think of it a small unidentified plane crashed into Lake Michigan a week ago go do you think that could have been yes it very well could have been don't tell me you don't have a way to stop the spread and development of this virus this guy is completely Bonkers of course there's a way when making a virus you obviously want to make a vaccine at the same time oh yes trust me we've been there prevents people from getting infected in the first place well you know not always for those who have already turned into monsters the vaccine euthanizes them mercifully if you have a vaccine like that man it it really is like a door the Explorer game the military carried off most of the vaccine can't stress it enough they took the lab animals too I think they said something about transporting everything by train they promised joint research but they stole it all without contributing a thing that's why I just can't trust the military this guy is insane hey give us that medicine there's still time to save everybody why why do you humans always insist on remaining human oh oh he in what's the matter it looks like the symptoms of my infection are beginning to show oh [ __ ] I have the vaccine right here then why don't you take it I don't want it oh man this this all sounds so familiar can't be used in its current form so what are we supposed to do this so close to home people don't want to vaccinate and [ __ ] and this is what happens to them but instead of shouting IRL they shout on Twitter what can we do the virus I created oh God it's now here inside my own body it's wonderful a new form of life so beautiful so beautiful it's really starting to lose it God this takes so long come on just turn I'll make a report making a safe State just in case is oh a man who creates the virus turns people into monsters is turning into a monster himself why did this man create beautiful scoop and why is he allowing it to overpower his own body now could it be that the guilty carries inside himself for his sins is making him do it I don't remember what to do here but that's enough run already uhoh uhoh beautiful [Applause] sounds wow oh man okay hello hey we can get in with this it won't quite be the merciful euthanization he mentioned though it's on me o Conor I don't really remember what here you go to do I'm stuck I was stuck I was [ __ ] stuck are you all right no God damn it who wants to die in a place like this I don't think anyone does retry okay so I don't really remember what to do I think it was oh I think I do remember let me see how though oh these loading screens we're just not used to these anymore it's not throwing me all the way at the beginning right take a look around viewers see guys that's why we make overflowing with great crowds of young people Club GOI is now as you can see that's why we do this is it cheating maybe a bit this VI a bit a man who creates a virus but it's worth it it's worth it let me make one here I don't think we use safe stage the last time we played it so I'm I'm allowing it myself [Music] now okay we need those cables I need to get around you somehow oh my God okay um how did I do this over here [Music] maybe okay maybe it wasn't [ __ ] no [ __ ] what do I do do I just really shower in with bottles for now hey we can get in with this it won't quite be the merciful euthanization he mentioned though maybe for now this is what I do could make a drink this on me come on here you go you can't have had nearly enough to drink yet I think this is I no I don't remember it's been 3 years since I played this okay here we go something's happening this guy has some bad drinking habits Ser now what the [ __ ] no maybe now I have to go back here yes keep away damn right [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] 9s trans oh [ __ ] you did it I don't know how I did it but I'll take it oh come on Jam to that I have no clue what happened but I did it I think I had to make it head but the the stage I don't know easy game next chapter I think we're like I don't remember how far we [Music] are quite at the end of the game but not not really like maybe an hour left well what do you want to do if we go right it'll take us to the forest building Adonis might be there if we go left it's Grant Park Station we might find the vaccine I'm worried about Adonis let's go to the forest building okay Forest build oh skipped it by accident doesn't matter as you can see we're here now inside Forest building it seems to have escaped monster attack for now now nothing seems to be out of place here I don't remember this let's go upstairs yes does the Str still working get in wait why does my why does that not work oh I see why I think I'll give you back some Channel points after the stream because that is unfair unfair now I think I'll check it myself now it works sorry Argan nice trle huh just my imagination imagination scary [Applause] shoot come on don't die now we like this reporter we want to keep it probably going to die though who am I kidding oh my God that's going to take a while oh yeah sure walk slower there's a door here I can see that let's go in housekeeping no one doors are warp you'll never open them Brisco this the menu the locker doors don't fit right if can't get them open try giving them whack oh oh oh now what oh found a key yeah come on go get it there's a key here I wonder what it's for probably a door oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [Applause] [ __ ] okay you got to really be fast here come on shoot it holy away we're so close to Dying God damn it all right open door maybe are you going to move okay I guess we go out this way I think she's going here y there's a door here I can see that it opened okay that was the lock door all right let's see what we got over here anything good she's on her way God she's so slow there's a door here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no good it doesn't look like the key we have will open it okay I'll find another key like that right there look there's something there I found it for you I can't really see it so small that's what she said go get it why this is the dumbest way why from over there it doesn't make [Music] sense this game I swear to God there's a door here I can see that open all right what's happening oh whoa It's Adonis what are you doing hiding in there don't come near me what are you talking talking about we came looking for you man idiots I told you to stay away huh uhoh huh what oh I think he has Corona y he's not vaccinated it shoot it what the hell are you saying Adonis our colleague no shoot it you dumb [Applause] [ __ ] [Music] Adonis it's no use the pistol won't work run was she dead did I kill her oh no we just ran away I'll take it next chapter that was short can't remember this part yeah I don't really remember it [Music] either poor Adonis he was a really great sound guy he joined the company after I did but I had a lot of respect for him we went there to save him but we ended up not being able to do a damn thing God damn it I I'm not sure maybe I'm going to skip these parts because they are really boring man this is awful it doesn't look like there are any survivors no huh well I guess we'd better get to the station all right did just just die and cheat a bit did hear that and reloaded a safe state it sounds like some kind of because it put me back all the way at the beginning beginning of the club let's hurry up and get out of here come on [ __ ] that now loading I think the the Black Mirror game had longer load screens than this [Music] you okay good evening this is Justine rhs our news team went to Club GOI and met with Dr OK Conor a biotech researcher we learned that the cause of the tragedy now occurring in Chicago is a new bioweapon developed by the military and zaka group sucking these balls there's a vaccine that can save people from the terror of the virus it could be located somewhere here in Grant Park Station the question is will we be able to find it well well well find out this is a ticket gate next episode of dat line ordinarily many people will be passing through these turn stalls in both directions but there isn't a soul here now whereis that's her spot oh there you are Brisco you [ __ ] going to do this [ __ ] again huh [ __ ] so there we go there's a train stopped at the platform let's go take a look oh there is oh blood oh no books scary it's Tom Riddle's Diary that look like some kind oh cultivating anti gagy cells antigen antig cells cultivated at room temperature however a culture medium of the following ingredients is required sodium chloride potassium chloride magnesium chloride antig gain cells can be cultivated successfully in a culture medium okay we need ingredients you find a questionable magazine in the trash my now have a look at this viewers a train this car looks like it might have been used for transporting some kind of animals these appear to be Pages they're empty now however a part of one of the cages is [Music] destroyed I think that was um I think Nicholas was in there Nicholas Cage I'll be here all night guys um next oh wait they look like some kind of research documents research report the game Furious fireus animal experiments being virus administer to lap subject subject were observed and God this deex goes so fast swear to [ __ ] God no particular out changes discernable no noticeable rise actions however begin to appear sluggish stage two subjects SP leech like objects looking almost like pieces of meat from their mouths possibly the fires veloped inside the body stage three the bodies of the subs begin to change dramatically as if becoming new life forms as their bodies change they become more aggressive they also become more sensitive to nearby sounds it ends up abruptly the rest is missing oh my God I'm getting good at this I'm getting good at this I'm reading faster and faster what the [ __ ] stay here where you going feels a bit weird chasing a girl with a camera like this but trust me it's my job okay it's it's just work oh God where the hell are we going what's the meaning of this yes okay this way and the station is huge like how she just runs here without saying anything oh is that a bodyink it is doesn't have a hat though oh it does never mind a dead body could it be one of Dr OKC Conor's underlings hey you're the news reporter here report it dummy [Music] dumb they look like some kind of research documents they have top secrets stand vacine culture for the gain virus antig gain cells are after called G cells are mutated G cells they have high immunity to the Gus anti-g cells are artificially created t- cells oh my God this goes so fast nobody can read that fast prent infection introduce G in The Bling via injection if the subject already has been affected in administration is difficult with a needle special vaccine ammo can be loaded into a head gun and administered from distance okay so we need we need some fiser bullets some some madna shotgun shells that's what we need you don't want a facine [ __ ] you you're getting one oh my God now now we run back there where the hell do you want to go all right back here I guess where's bris oh brisco's there never mind hi Brisco are we there yet oh my God running a [ __ ] Marathon here any n magazines in here no time to go digging through the trash actually I have all the time in the world another dead body great okay as you can see there's a woman's body here I can see yeah she appears to have been a researcher imagine seeing this on the new attack by that be [ __ ] weird it looks like she has something in her hand what is it dick it appears to be a bottle of chemicals oh the bottle is broken and the contents all right BR and thanks for the rate man appreciate it what was I'll see you later man have good sleeps I just I just have to finish this game today effective anti G cells have same function as t- cells found natural on the human body they create antibodies against G virus if already has been infected with the G virus and G cells are rejected ultimately resulting to the subject's death warning functioning of the antg cells drops markedly with any rise in blood alcohol for this reason alcohol intake after Administration is strictly prohibited alcohol in the blood also has been proven to grease the fence the G oh that's why I didn't drink Al the ingredients are written on the bottle sodium chloride potassium chloride magnesium chloride apparently they make a culture medium for the vaccine with these ingredients but these ingredients are pretty common I bet we could find other things that have them what really yes I bet we could find everything we need in a convenience store waa W I think there was a convenience store nearby let's go doesn't look like it oh what the [Music] [ __ ] okay I don't know what to do yeah let's just run just trying to kill it the usual way isn't going to work with this monster something I can do here maybe [ __ ] that's a [ __ ] dead end isn't it no no Justine what are you [Music] doing maybe that stuns it I have no [ __ ] idea what to do Justine just stays [Music] there justtin is [ __ ] dead I don't know what to do I have no [ __ ] idea [Music] yeah okay whatever early start tomorrow all right argon I'll see you later have a good one thanks for [Music] hanging think I just have to go I I remember being stuck [Music] here maybe I can do something from the other [Music] platform I don't know what I'm [Music] doing this is blocked off I really don't know what I'm [Music] doing sounds like [ __ ] Christmas here all right maybe it is the other side because there was a signal light thing don't see it anymore I'm pretty sure I saw a red light [Music] there the red light oh I completely missed that yeah I'm sorry I completely missed that [Music] oh my God [ __ ] sounds hi sir I'm back excuse me maybe I can shoot it good call I just panicked because I I thought I have to be super fast can I oh my [Music] god really choo choo [ __ ] all right that works Justino she is Justine okay hello who said that did you hear something just now anybody there who the [ __ ] says that help I didn't know it would completely skip the scene hey thanks a lot you saved me I slightly remember this here let me repay you huh I lost my ID card oh well whatever oh well it won't do me any good now anyway but I really want to thank you guys sure thing it was nothing we just did what anybody would have done sure by the way what are you going to do now do you want to come with us with you hurt like that it's too dangerous out here for you and if we go to the airport the military is supposed to come evacuate us thanks but I'll be okay I have to stay here and wait for somebody wait wait for somebody here yeah so I can't go with you I can't just desert my friend desert nice I guess not well I guess we better get going if we all get through this alive get a hold of us someday at our office we'd like to do a peace on you promise sure I'll do that bye Justine oh got I got a follower [Music] goodbye this game is longer than I remembered what's that it's a special type of ammo that could be packed with the vaccine ah the fiser I we could load your pistol with it fiser bullets and then we shoot monsters with it right right but first we have to get the vaccine let's go I love how they they find the vaccine and you can just get it at the [ __ ] Supermarket now such an amazing game the kits of these days really missed something with the PlayStation 2 era those were the days who we can just what yes let's go store oh [ __ ] waiting for you oh we're going [Music] didn't get the culture medium but we're going to ven store 40 ingredients do you really think we'll find a substitute for the culture medium at the no hi this is a place yep that is a convenience store we're looking for sodium chloride potassium chloride and magnesium chloride remember right I know hey hold on we just barely started to look around calm down I wasn't planning on leaving hey don't steal anything oh he's on to me we TV news teams have certain standards to uphold you know to uphold um this drd tried going to the station but I couldn't find anything looks like somebody was doing something here though maybe it's the person after our lives I guess I better leave this place for now M that Mark okay here [Music] oh just a mannequin of course what would a horror game be without a mannequin uhoh what's in there we going to look in there no okay okay uh let's check in the back find a beverages shelves what do you suppose is in this one caramel coloring aspartame caffeine this one's no good that sounds like a baa [Music] zero tea milk sugar vitamin C sodium gluconate this won't work either God damn it check that what about the sports stre there we go saccharide sodium chloride oh hey shut up flavorings amino acid sodium citrate calcium lactate potassium chloride oh that's two and magnesium chloride Bingo sports drink the cure for Corona there are lots of ingredients mixed in there we don't need too though doesn't matter at this point who cares I bet it'll do the trick anyway that's why I'm so healthy bases his confidence on let's go we'll be be able to make the vaccine with this and Escape let's get to the airport I think the last time I had monster was your place nah forget about that place not only do we have the culture medium but we've got tape with the truth on it too as long as we have those we've got the upper hand I don't care if we're up against the

everything to YouTube in two hour parts so if like I have two parts now from two hours if this is going to be done in 20 minutes then the last part is going to be 20 minutes it doesn't make sense all right it triggers my autism all right this is our last report good luck leave it to me wow we kept her alive for so long don't do toour Parts on YouTube yeah maybe stand by three two one go what's retention I don't really check because nobody they don't get fuse the only thing that gets fused is my shorts airport in an attempt to evacuate Chicago this is just my my my my nice little archive as you can see the airport just like everything else is blanketed by thick fog visibility is practically zero we've received information that a military transport will be arriving here I always like two our parts myself though like like what should I do what do people like let's go I was like PE watching people like Gap smolders and that's always like around two hours is we're now here inside the control room there isn't anybody here now we have to ask will a military transport really be landing here to rescue [Music] civilians something is coming in over the radio I wonder who it is oh no this is the six Air Force [Music] 27441 we are now cing overhead ready to do it YouTube is actually fun but it doesn't work like the way I do it which is just throwing your streams on [Applause] [Music] YouTube this is a great taser control room yeah exactly because the only thing that does work is my shorts that's all I'm still going to keep on doing it because I like having my own little thought archive but maybe I should that on a separate account that's [Music] what you but which one is for the runway lights God it sounded so horri know which button this one nope no good this doesn't work either yeah I guess but then you have to edit and if there's one thing I really hate in life it's editing like I don't want to learn it's it's not [Applause] fun figure out there land a landmark or something pay me to do it well that was fast nah nah can't do everything I'll stick to Twitch streaming it's most fun I can't move I can't do anything because I didn't pay attention [ __ ] great what do you want me to do okay I don't know what to do uh Brisco help this hey look at that map there's that Lighthouse you're right the lighthouse the lighthouse would be good Landmark right that would be fine okay we've located it on our map now if you'll just turn on the lighthouse Beacon we can land okay hold on a while then but You' got to hurry we're running out of fuel all right let's get to that Lighthouse come on Lighthouse is the last part I think oh [ __ ] hey come on what's taking you guys so long it's funny though because if I upload short games like please forgive me and grunenberg those are the only videos people actually watch that has like you know watch time of few hours or 10 hours well here that really shows that people don't have it looks like we all made it in time time to watch full games anymore is that right in that Cas you'd better hurry to the lighthouse we all have a detention the swords we really do we just want a 20 second video and that's it what was that thing did you drive it away maybe it ran off thank you all very much it was her again man it was Pamela Pamela you mean Pamela marel but what happened to her Look chief just wait in the security office for us while we go to the lighthouse we'll be back all right will we now okay this shorter than I thought it uh who in the world are you that's what she said by the way finally real people at last I have no idea what's going on where did all this fall what is that shirt we don't have any time to waste on this guy we shoot him we've got to get to the ligh house whoa whoa who who who who W no touching hey shoot him I've been so lonely all by myself shoot him don't leave me I can't shove him this guy is looking really sick I trust him I he's infected with that virus virus no it's just this weird looking suit talk and he's missing a shoe I don't have a cold or anything oh okay this guy doesn't realize what's happening to him I didn't know what I was going to do I woke up and everybody was gone where could Dr OK Conor be I wonder what did you say don't tell me you're Dr OK Conor's guinea pig oh he's in the club what you know Dr o Conor too where is he in the club that Dr o Conor is so mean poking and prodding a guy's body like he was nothing oh my God the story of this game is so stupid and when I woke up he was gone too it's so dumb Corona but Corona didn't happen yet what the heck is going on hey you guys and the Cure The Cure sport Conor to come back that's the fa scine sport ring wait a minute don't go [Laughter] wait wow someone got paid to do that over there do you see that I don't come on I'll raise you what the this guy's losing it oh he lost it actually can't we shoot him I don't really know what to do [Music] actually away from me shoot him stay away this guy is nuts what do you want to do yes he is I want to go to the lighthouse hey but you know as well as I do Brisco there we go he's not human anymore shoot him again oh [ __ ] where's Dr o Conor Dr o Conor yo what's up canoli how you doing sir y I don't get this game I swear to [ __ ] God shoot him I have no idea what I'm doing here yeah this game is it's it's something it's it's hard to explain it's it's a matter of you had to be there there we [ __ ] [Music] go ow that hurts don't kill me me please don't kill me but I suppose you have to but might supposed to feel bad now I think I'm supposed to feel bad what is with this guy huh oh it's falling out yeah he's losing it oh my God run run for your lives okay that's not that's not nasty at all yeah this game is just lovely such a beautiful game I just I remember this game too well some parts I just remember like it's yesterday the fog that guy he was what was causing everything in some parts I don't at all like this transport I don't see it anywhere let's just get to the lighthouse yeah can we go now yay I think this is the last part already we made it to the lighthouse now all we have to do is turn on the beacon I'm tired say prisco why you two guys go on up without me I'd say that's enough reporting why like how how much do these people get paid because oh my God what are we doing out here how did they not quit yet running around in a sea of dead bodies pretending to do news report it's all just nonsense that's not true even if we don't make it there'll still be the videotapes somebody will see the truth they'll see us and they'll know we're alive but it's all just meaningless even trying to find out the truth behind what's been happening it's meaningless people will never know the truth everything will all go back to normal as if nothing ever happened everybody will forget about us no trust me this game is like 20 years old I've not forgotten I don't have the strength to take another step you two go on without me all right if that's the way you feel it's too bad though come on let's go that's what I said I would have built the first time some of the wall [ __ ] would have happened whatever there yeah exactly I'd be like [ __ ] this I'm working from home but no these guys just this man just keeps filming they just keep going their boss is a dick too like we've seen her she's she's horrible so this is the lighthouse huh that is indeed a lighthouse Brisco looks like it's just you and me now uhoh well let's get this don't get ideas no no no no no no hey Oh you mean to den what do you think of Justine you know what I think I think that reporter knows who's behind all this stuff that's been going on I think so that one's the chief's favorite after all yeah and that damn Chief she was the one that forced us all into this whole mess from the start man Brisco is mov damn Chief the next time I see her I swear I'm going to oops you're going to oops I forgot you were getting this on camera oh yeah me too sorry you'll edit that part out won't you I don't edit screw that it appears to be on an electrical control panel oh really I wouldn't have guess what man that guy they were experimenting on do you think he was what was causing the fog and what was up with that plane that crashed into Lake Michigan I just don't know this must be it yes this is the power supply to the lighthouse that that's like that that kind of looks like uh all the equipment I need to make this microphone sound good come on let's go up to the top but apparently you can also power a lighthouse with it so that's cool all these deaths we've seen everything's all confused in my head now I get this feeling some of these murders didn't have anything to do with the virus at all I guess I've probably just about got the whole thing figured out hey hey what do you think not much actually who do you think's behind all of this stuff you now's your chance this is your opportunity to let everybody know know exactly what you think I think it's how about it government won't talk with the camera on hey George Bush that's what I think coward Bill Gates also behind us completely cleared away I don't see that transport anywhere though it looks like they deserted us but who cares if they don't rescue us now brisco's going dark that fog there won't be any monsters we can go anywhere we want I don't know why but I feel so you don't know why dude we've been climbing up a lighthouse very good all of a sudden yeah no [ __ ] [ __ ] destroyed wow oh I think it's the same ending as last time I think there's multiple endings though but don't know how to get them thany [Music] winky that smug smile that was it that was it the last part of mission I thought we had so much longer left though I could have finished this yesterday whatever I can probably just uh Ed did this to the last part of YouTube but I don't know I don't care I blink two times yeah that's how fast I am um not sure if that's something to be proud of but I am look I'm not a creep guys a Divine being who is well known and has a strong belief in rational ISM next game we're we're going to spin the wheel wait is there more no right oh there is more sorry I'll never forget you Nina your beautiful eyes your lovely black hair that soft translucent skin of yours and Nina I'll never forgive the guys that put you in this situation I don't remember this it's [Laughter] oh all right that was Michigan that was a that was an awesome awesome game to replay 

GREYHILL INCIDENT:
all right welcome to game number 13 out of 100 the gry hill incident it's about aliens that's all I know I know it's not very well received and I know it's fairly short so it should be a one shot should be able to finish it today let's uh let's Dive Right In see what this is about well obviously aliens I think how long to Beats at about 2 hours so that is a steep price Jesus exactly that's a steep price 2 hours like I think it was [Music] 25 is is my trigger Fire stuck guys can you hear me my husb or something next to our car again [ __ ] but he said it looked like an alien but they ran into the cornfields and disappeared I'm going to call the police Amy don't I don't trust the cops or the government or anyone else for that matter and you shouldn't trust them either we created our neighborhood watch for this exact reason Brandon I understand the situation but this needs to stop it's also absolutely irresponsible to send Ryan out tonight Amy don't tell otherwise we all guys the the sound is a bit too loud bit lower end up in The Nut House are you trying to tell them we think there's little green men running around gray Brandon they are gray the only thing we can do is the audio okay guys feel like it's still loud I'll try to rest a bit Amy trust me you don't want to end up in the psych Lord I've paid a high price to Break Free the only way to escape you've told your stupid story a thousand times in Vietnam we dealt with things worse than that almost every day what does Vietnam have to do with it whatever I always wear my tinf foil hat when I leave my camper van I believe the aliens have the ability to control us through telepathic Powers convinced that the protects me what up wantet the game is a grey Hill incident Henry's been acting strange since he came

whole lot of games yep I'm going broke I think I remember there being a fence through the corn field I just need to get around The Silo over there finish all of them I have to finish all of them any

insect they'll take samples of everything making experiments of everyone this is an extraterrestrial investigation this can't be I don't want to end up as an alien experiment victim they already cleaned your house so I don't think they're going to come back I've already started to board up your place this will save us tonight hey calm down that's my my house all right problem I used up all

hell hole wow what a [ __ ] game did I mention that this game is really shitty I don't [ __ ] on games that fast but oh my God this has been the most tedious piece of [ __ ] I played in a long time I don't know if the aliens are on my ass is that blood no use more Charizard yes I just went in a complete circle what the [ __ ] that is so weird okay I somehow what the hell this game does no shut up does not make sense what the hell looks like the light from the shed what oh there Ryan Ryan are you here hello Bobby Ryan yeah b a few of them greeted me some minutes ago while I was out working on the Caravan after taking a photo shoot I asked him if they wanted to have some Coke but Bob it's okay all good I got it just joking I imprisoned one in the bedroom and I put a tin foil hat on him I'm going to make some experiments but I won't probe him I swear stop maybe sell them on the got Brandon's daughter so I'm a little busy what do you need I found a solution to make the Caravan work it'll take me a few minutes to get done Bob that's great that's what I needed to hear can we go be our chance to get out of this town I have to save Rachel first she's trapped in the barn by the gas station I'm going to get her then we can make a plan to save Henry yes ran we have to be fast with Henry I know where to go didn't start drilling into his teeth Bob can you not say [ __ ] like that I don't even want to think about it I heard Brandon causing trouble for them on the saucer through Amy's walking I think they're all the same [ __ ] that's good Ryan Jesus Christ all right can we just fix the Caravan take one of the aliens name him Paul take him with us and just go to the field what field I think I'm going in the wrong direction this way shouldn't go that way not this way it's the field CU this field somehow no Gates this looks like some sort of gate but no oh [Music] here that an alien yeah that's an alien oh there's one too can't believe I'm avoiding them no can't get in all right other oh for [ __ ] sake hi stop nope [ __ ] this leave me alone it's crazy [ __ ] God damn it where am I all the way back here oh my God it's because I walked all this way I'm stupid checkpoint put

god there's one right there no [Music] dead end [ __ ] least that ammo or something I need that I'm about to lose my shits [ __ ] me all right so got to go all the way to the back get the [ __ ] bolt

folks enjoyed yourself catch you on later down the road hey Rachel what was your favorite part about the story of great Hill Bob who are you just talking to that is uh probably copyrighted music guys we're going to spin the wheel and we're going to the next game and forget we have ever played this one out of 10 very shitty don't buy it

LEMPO:
game number 14 I hope this is better than the last game the grey hle incident was an incident I don't want to think about anymore but um let's get back to back to Earth and let's dive into a new game it's called lmpo it's based on Finnish mythology and that's all I know adding weight to the wheel adding a game no there should be another Redemption that's adding a game yeah you have ADD game to the wheel which is only 100 points and 1,000 points is you add weight to the wheel and let me show you real quick when you add weight it gets bigger you go too yeah no [ __ ] that [ __ ] that it has to be a horror game okay be a horror game all right let me check if there are let me unplug my controller do we enable hints it's enabled it's not enabled now [Music] so supposed to be a dark game play as dark as you dare all [Music] right I mean it was pretty scary right about that still okay yes let's see what this is all about about the game lmpo is probably not your average horror game in it you will get a little lost there's a big emphasis on exploring figuring things out yourself expect no handholding about the community anyone anyone playthrough of lmpo is likely to be incomplete if you want to delve deeper into the world feel free to discuss things online and share your findings and experiences about brightness the dark atmosphere of the game makes it suspectable of the changes in ambient light of the room you play in may need to adjust the brightness settings depending on the time of day you play in a dark room you can turn the brightness down in bright room you have to turn it up okay I'm going to have to turn it up because I have really bright lights on my face because of the green screen [ __ ] you go under a love spell men run and follow to a maze where love and Men turn Hollow only a few can escape others you were working on a preos stand I am I am can't just C all well I guess we're going to get lost in a forest for the next couple of hours have you ever got lost in the woods oh even for a while I have actually it's scary as [ __ ] first you're in a place where you've been a hundred times you know where you're coming from and you know where you're heading you can't even imagine getting lost in here it doesn't even cross your mind but then you see something interesting like a cute animal or a good mushroom spot and you take a couple steps off the path you take a photo or pick up the mushrooms and when you turn back everything looks different your heart skips a beat don't eat the mushrooms find your way back to the right path of course this usually lasts only a minute and you're back on track in no time sometimes it can take a while and sometimes you get the forest in Amsterdam yeah the fondal park man that's when you call someone and they send rescue people couldn't find my way out what if they can't find you what if you are so lost all right St see you later dude it's impossible for them to find you have a great even fantasy worlds I didn't either until I found myself in I'm actually quite excited for this one I'm intrigued the night started out as any night I was the last to leave the office as usual who this feels like that one game that really old one like one late night what a week what is that is that my my my lungs Vitality current objectives close down the office before leaving cut with a picture of a Paar on it not much to it okay Stanley Parable yeah kind of well milk that a sausage it is think [ __ ] H jez Jesus there anything on my desk I want to check out I guess we just close I needed to turn off the lights first Ty says what's red and bad for your teeth a brick red and bad for your teeth a brick is it oh my God a dog oh my God what that what what does that mean in Finish mythology we need Sophia here where sopia ever ate a brick uh no but I tried to buy the jawbreaker once when I was younger so that's kind of the same toy dog want to name Elizabeth written on the bottom what's brown and sticky stick dark [Laughter] [ __ ] why is that funny I'm so stupid why is that funny hello oh what's that infinite light source okay that's nice I like infinite light sources and just like that I was lost ah the mushroom eating a mushroom will give you a little bit of fatality back I am really intrigued so far it really bugged me that I couldn't find the office I was certain I hadn't wandered that far and the forest around me didn't seem familiar at all okay what is this I soon started to realize that I wasn't just simply lost I was in a whole other place all right resisting the dark Forces of the forest is tiring and slowly consumes Your vitality aha I got a battery one of these should give you plenty of power to any suitable device I got the wood and dog and two mushrooms all right let's just walk around follow this thing I guess who stick this a lake it is this wasn't my idea of a family Zone oh family Zone that's what that means okay Elijah old stroller but how why you have to Teddy when he was little can open your inventory Souls documents Elijah Drew this a couple of years ago Mor around to help with the labels of course okay gliders what is this not mushroom Soul residue what the hell is that hold on let me fix something on Tik Tok because I think it's going to be a lot better do it like this I felt that all I could do was to keep moving I'd eventually end up somewhere I hear a phone is that a phone that's what I said Sarah Davies I'll read that in a bit hold up let me pick up this phone housekeeping honey Miranda Paul are you there yeah it's me it's good to hear your voice oh thank God I thought I was going crazy could you please send someone I'm lost in the forest behind the office D you've been here for 2 minutes you're not lost Rangers are on the way I was so worried when he didn't come home I'm sorry I I don't understand what happened and there was a weird light and Sly I just didn't know where I was anymore calm down honey just stay there and wait for the Rangers okay sit down and breathe this a bit dramatic yes honey what is this phone where did you get this number don't worry love just wait there and relax someone will come for you soon tell me how you got this number this is just just a phone in the middle of a forest how can someone call here how does this even work try to calm down honey don't worry about it we'll get you back home soon just stay there I hung up the phone and decided that staying still was the last thing I was going to do yeah [ __ ] that the voice was hers but that couldn't have been her my sanity was failing Sarah Dave is 19 years old dat of bird July 5th 1993 uh blah blah blah blah live love left tattoo on right arm okay is that in my documents now no I can't pick it up oh I can there we go can I use this no like he's a bit dramatic he's been in the forest for like two seconds and already saying he's super lost I could probably find the office back maybe not I don't know what the [ __ ] is a minecart doing here okay that makes sense base six I don't even have that crafting confirmed that's just going to turn into a Minecraft kind of game I mean it would scare the crap out of me if a creeper just creeped up on me right now that'd be scary okay so we need some soul residue for that I've been here right that's where I came from what's over here oh okay a candle I thought there was someone here oh there we go hold up let's try to open it now yeah I don't know what the orb is just left left go to that M shaft again okay I got to I don't want to up the brightness too much but I need it a little bit Yeah cuz I I'm got to get a headache man that's that's the Cy thing about having a green screen you need a lot of [ __ ] lights and if you have a dark game you're squinting and you're going to have a headache bit better now oh [ __ ] where was it here here all right open wait six oh I thought I needed four [ __ ] sunglasses I'm wearing sunglasses at night I mean Sean does that I don't think I have sunglasses I always destroy my sunglasses or lose them in mosh bits I buy sunglasses once a year and then I go to festivals and I just lose them in mosh bits all the [ __ ] time what is that okay got another battery you supposed to wear them not eat them then why so tasty thought it was a trap for a second oh my God it is easy to get lost here so many mushrooms so hello what's this what the [ __ ] is scared the [ __ ] out of me [Music] somehow you can reactivate the structure later to save again oh so this is where you save huh that's weird what is it is it like a ah I see manual safing yeah that's going to be fun what's this this where Billo bin lives a door there seems to be two objects missing oh hi all right needs two kidneys the same as doing groceries in 2023 okay hold up what is this a cabin lighter looks like a small cabin with a window buying chariz CS true true I still got to sell my Blastoise before it goes down in price by the way it's it's like a free 50 bucks dount [ __ ] I was going to give my Blastoise to uh to a friend but she already pulled it so now I can just sell it aha you came yippi my name is Elizabeth the old man who lived here never played with me that's the dog may you play Let's go hide and seek I hide first find me I swear the light only made some twinkling noise but somehow I understood it perfectly 152 okay that was a bit easy noses well you only have one eyes two and your right hand yeah five fingers right press to zoom it can be helpful when handling small items that's what she said cabin key what the [ __ ] there a mark of a protected place oh there's enemies all right um read this sleep 31 I don't know if the entity is just toying with me but I found some pretty convincing looking lab equipment in the cave out of here could be it someone knows about this place or even managed to study it that would mean that there most likely is a safe way out too could something like this have remained the secret I'll investigate further tomorrow sleep bir too looks like there has not been anyone on the site for some time sleep 33 I found a second metal ear that looks like it could fit into one of the stone doors outside it was in the cave going to use it now in case it's on one of those disappearing things the code to the door was written on document 4499 so that's [Music] South oh my God an elderly Wanderer came and knocked on the door last night his jaw was covered by a large white beard and His Eyes by the hood of his cape he smelled like Conifer liquor and honey and didn't speak much I offer you my mother's protection what did he say about my mom um after that he pushed me aside and stepped in and waved his hand a few times next to a wall chanting words that made no sense to me I thought he might be UND drug so I didn't try to stop him those people can do anything if provoked after maybe a minute he was done and left without a word this morning a glowing picture had appeared on the wall only adds to the strange things happening here but the encounter with the man someone made me feel safe trolls I wouldn't be surprised dark figure standing on the flower field is that a grave I can take this what is this that is a good question how did I zoom in no clue what I'm looking at I'll take it time of day doesn't seem to change here I've decided to start counting my sleeps I don't know how many times I've slept before I started counting maybe nine it's now sleep two officially sleep three I met a man he doesn't talk much but he seems to have been here a long time I gathered that he was once a sailor of some kind first I was happy to see someone but he can't help me he said there's only one way out wouldn't say what it is he has a nice dog the damn dog stole my compass the Sailor didn't care when I told him fortunately this place is so small I can quite easily find my way around without without it stupid dog I could use that Compass though comp compass compass compass compass compass wait what did I get a map hand dra I can't open it though oh I can sleep is that everything what if I sleep try to get some sleep but it's difficult to relax her your sleep is restless sleeping Mak an easy target for lmpo you heal fully but a little Max Fidelity every time you fall asleep okay that was probably not the best idea [Music] then seems fine I was on my way sir flashlight All Battery operate oh that's why I find batteries all the time oh that's a lot better do I need it not really yeah it's a lot better actually found you what is this oh Jesus M for map ooh thanks imperfect oh my God okay we got the lake in the middle all right this is good think I might be going south here Middle Earth I think so oh there check this out though I don't think I have anything to break this with just yet didn't find the proper hiding place yet I want to go again okay fine I'll follow what is Serpent's trial Stone when snakes have their trials in their spring they hold these stones in their mouth if loaded with snake Blood Stone can give back your strength filling the stone consumes Soul res okay that's a heal all right okay you can all right okay so this should also appear yeah we're definitely at the South now so should be able to find a um what was it compass in wait was it a mine what was it wasn't this one well it was to the South that's what I remember I don't think I ever picked up that note or something let me check this three of them and a battery not bad there's a mushroom here H mushroom all right 86 is our Vitality it doesn't go down too fast so that's nice I'm going to have to find a way up here I guess might not be that easy oh I was just here damn it I'm so far I'm really liking this game the shell as in uh can I get some gas for my car here game before this was pretty cool too I really enjoyed that that was uh I wish I could play it again how you doing peasy fresh Soul get comfy there's no getting back we are all here for good stuck until lmpo is eaten Al there is to eat we nothing but dry strings literally lurking for a while so I hear being Bleak but just just how it is one thing you can maybe do is to prolong your being supposed to be a small bell here somewhere could help you avoid the things that should be avoided like drugs a [Music] bell a gym yeah that that sounds like something you should avoid oh [ __ ] [Music] puzzles a [ __ ] okay oh no so many next game just kidding just k that could be nice oh instructions okay elevator step is broken thanks for fixing things George I rigged one of the other steps to function as a backup just use the usual lever to control the platforms and then use the backup here what oh oh my God okay I am I'm not getting back there oh [Music] wow great oh hi always remember to lower the first steps after you using them we don't want any creatures getting to the upper controls close [Music] no wait can't I pick this up okay I should take him not right Mouse click and leave them what I've been doing all this time whoopsie [Music] that one doesn't do [Music] [ __ ] I can't make that jump can I no close all right dude I'll see you later um yeah most likely that I'll still be playing this tomorrow God damn it no I need this one find a troll you have to put your Cola in the fridge maybe oh my God this [ __ ] game look I don't [ __ ] know let me check what this is cuz it's been bothering me S of I'm being ble oh that's I've been there [Music] how do I do this I really don't get it that one go down up actually [Music] [Music] um close ah okay I what close close close close [Music] the use of this one good night dude see you later um okay I need the last one I think that one down oh that doesn't make sense trying to figure this out but Jesus pretty tough look how didn't I try everything by now okay that's the first three now that one down oh what the [ __ ] come on can I really not make this no oh [ __ ] that hurts [Music] whoopsie oh why am I doing this I'm just I'm not that great at puzzles guys I oh you're [ __ ] kidding me I had it right there I had it right there okay now flip you up and that should be it yes okay holy [ __ ] no that's not it I'm really close this is not doing anything right okay so that would be I'm going assume this one okay and then flip this down too that lowers that one oh my God okay everything down one two three four oh [ __ ] I thought I had it that's this one I guess oh no everything up I was hoping this might go up late but no I guess that would be one way to do it but it's probably not the way oh my God how can I struggle so much this they said the puzzles would be easy where it right see this is as far as I can get but then I'm missing one that's can't figure out which one boom boom boom boom okay I think that's just what we [Music] do no what the [ __ ] why is that one stuck now [ __ ] am I hearing interesting fun puzzle I'm not having so much fun now [Music] I guess that'll do don't really know what that did honestly does that flip that one open is that is that what that does oh it puts some down okay I see I see nothing here oh really imperfect now now I kind of want to try it I think I'm just way too tired for puzzles today I think I can just oh you're right you're right it was actually quite easy Jesus that took me so long thanks [Music] imperf that took me so long I just got to be brave you think so I just got to be brave oh my God yep just got to be brave too close so many times oh that must be must have been God awful to watch if you know you know the combination [Laughter] sorry I I'd be screaming at my PC surely took your time even if fish oh think this rock is a bit weird I think it's weird I don't know I mean it's it's a rock oh yeah oh it's [Music] safe I'm actually I'm I'm really liking the game so far so I love the atmosphere the mystery I remember hoping so bad that there would be someone inside the shell I would be in trouble for being somewhere I clearly shouldn't be but at least I wouldn't be alone um maybe I like being alone though solv in your own way that's nice feels nice was gravity wasn't working I took my own my own route oh wait wait what was it [Music] 44 no please let please tell me I picked up that note I might not have done that oh that is so sad I didn't pick up that note it was 44 88 oh thank God every time I check a note I've been right clicking so I've been putting it back hello is someone here that's a bit stupid cuz I should have picked it up but thankfully I remembered it someone is worried about a mixing oxygen container one oxygen canister is unaccounted for most likely due to someone failing to report when changing the canister it's not that hard people use the list what is happening no key card contamination must remain closed under all circumstances battery item 4658 the levitating cube in the center of the cave bit loud here center of the cave is a cube made of unknown material probably some metal seems to be floating in the air there's an electric field of some kind surrounding it when we started measuring it three weeks ago the pulsating Force went initiated when once every 63 seconds for a couple of days the Interpol stayed constant but after that it has slowly been happening more and more at the time of writing this B's Interpol is 55 seconds the electric force around the cube has not changed but it remains impossible to penetrate the force destroys every instrument we take too close a guard even tried to shoot it but we were able to determine from a slow motion video capture that the bullet vaporized before contact with the rock we believe there to be something inside the cube or initial measurements suggest some kind of mechanism but the force around it makes research challenging I'm having uh oh see I do it again fake like lost Vibes oh okay the spores appear to belong to a spectacular fungus-like plant it grew so fast that we decided to contain it for security purposes seems to be really reactive to sounds and movements around it but nothing seems to affect its growth it might have reached the maturity of some kind since it has not grown significantly for a couple of days um it is now a little over a meter tall the sports have slight poisonous qualities to humans of Eden or inhaled further studies should only be conducted with appropriate safety measures okay don't put it back six batteries in inventory okay oh this is it right jeese cheese uh let me I'm probably dead if I get closer there we go PE C so close so close oh my God damn it wait what am I dead is this Heaven I don't remember much of my first time in limbo I think I did I think it was pretty empty and bright as hell I think I got the Green Card what is this every death takes it all here you return at something less and without without your essence you only return back to your prison oh there's a okay let's uh let's check that out so should it be in my inventory it is in my inventory let's hope it works let's find out go back down it's nice that you do keep your items if you die hug um that works oh it works that seems like it's fixed the matter has become unstable I can no longer work on it fure looking device probably a Hightech key or some sort okay I need a code here and I wait it's a phone yeah it go straight to voicemail again well it's been a week now since your last contact it's becoming undoubtedly clear that something's gone wrong but we're working on the assumption that you're still alive and well and uh rest assured that we're doing all that we can here to get you out of their ASAP okay now please whatever you do don't leave the shell do not leave the shell we might only be able to activate the connection for a brief moment and it's immensely important that you stay nearby we hope to see you all soon stay strong or just random yeah it seems like quite a large game so no probably some bugs here and there well it's been a week now since your last contact it's becoming undoubtedly clear that something gone wrong but we're working on the assumption that your still alive and well and uh rest assured that we're doing all

a brief moment and it's immensely important that you stay nearby we hope to see you all soon stay strong there's more battery I I don't know felt like I was done there but there is another way here [Music] so check it out hold on let me let me check something real [Music] quick okay you're listening to the m radio the night is long and rather dark today but it has been this way forever already so no real surprise there our newest contestant Paul has been lost in the forest for a while now will he ever stop his futile attempts to get back to his boring job only time will tell now stay tuned for some music from the north whoa is that what all Finnish people listen to I Love It that's where I came from I think yes so then sleep I don't need to sleep no no no no no it's our national anthem

device I see I used that one hey I know what that is now does this show the answer or something it it looks like there's someone standing at the puzzle we did I don't know okay it feels really weird and wrong to just go back out into the forest but I think I have to I think I'm done here I could check that side Maybe yes there is more okay never mind I'm not done I'm not sure who did what but somehow I think two people got caught in a rock blast there was nothing left to identify him with just blood everywhere I don't know if the rock did something unusual or if um or was some equipment misplaced but Travers device was destroyed in the last as well we have no way of getting home or contacting base travel to this Dimension back excuse me what the hell was that where was I travel to this Mansion back so many times that it started to feel ordinary forgot how groundbreaking technology we had and how impossible it is to replace without help from the outside there is no food the water in the Shell tastes like rust can hear the creatures every time I close my eyes I don't think I will make it the what there's nothing that fits here that's what she said can I open this yes I can they don't deserve you the oh whisper set trust me they don't oh okay cool makes my finger tingling thanks appreciate it w this game is really cool the gore made me nauseous it was obvious that something horrible had happened to the people that I was hoping to find I think there's much left of them no oh I feel like I'm not seeing the entire thing here and okay can't do anything here shows a hand but you can't really use anything out of your inventory too right there's no use button does it show anything [Music] no uh what miss miss something there maybe I can go down here oh hello it

okay so can refal hidden secrets okay might know what to do with that the glowing Rock turned out to be not very radioactive but it might be wise to keep it in the container till we get back to HQ color of the rock is not stable we still don't know what it reacts to so far we measured pretty much all wavelengths between 300 and 500 andm okay I think that might have been what I've been missing

if I I love open games where you can explore everything and it can be quite difficult I I love all that but if it if you have to back track a lot that doesn't feel good anymore in in like 2023 so I love it when a game doesn't let you backrack oh that's so creepy I love it get out okay thanks that's pretty cool you can translate that for me go down here again this is open now okay what is is that nope nope nope nope nope [Applause] nope holy [Applause] [ __ ] that is so loud I uh [ __ ] up there yep I'm dead again all right um simply dying was no Escape nope you return as something less and with your essence you return only back to your prison this will lead me back what if I go this way let me explore what's over here [Music] I can't do anything here yet interesting go back I think that puts me back inside the shell yep very cold and very heavy all right let's try to get away from it this time hold up can I make it a bit less loud oh it's gone now okay where am I okay I guess we are

every step you take it's it's yeah I'm liking it it's a bread of fresh air because before this I've been playing The Grey Hill incident and oh my God I hated that game this this is nice boom okay I don't know what I'm doing here I think I need to complete this and then I don't know I let me check my notes nah I can do this yet little frustrating I don't mind a little frustrating my son had always loved swimming and for a passing moment the calming sound of waves pushed aside the anxiety and brought memories of Elijah until I woke up to the reality I shouldn't be hearing waves anywhere near my office that makes sense unto oh okay I can't take this hold up you wait there wait there I'll be [Music] back uh here no no wouldn't that be easy I had to try but yeah that would be a bit too easy Captain goes down with the ship why was I Left Alive travel West and save yourself I'll go east and see if the sun still rises there a pipe as if it was just uh made yesterday smooth and shiny smells like burnt tobacco can't pick it up it doesn't leave me alone the stone it Whispers to me it wants me to open it fell from the sky is a ball of fire my ears were ringing the next day still I cannot sleep a full night without awaken me tries to tell me something that black block of rock no stone I've ever seen before it had a picture on the front when it fell was rather shattered managed to copy it before it crumbled accordion cool seems to be broken me yeah I know nothing about music yeah same I can take that did it oh my God I got to learn how to take these man I don't know why I always press right Mouse button seems to be a note inside this is a a sodoku note hold up I want to read it last message I'm not sure who did what but somehow I think two people got caught in the RO

They Call My Name fear not I'm coming home pay respects f did that bird just drop that heard of [ __ ] on my face ooh it's so old that it feels bit brittle in hand seems to be working in order though

try okay I need to figure out where that door was I think it's bottom there oh what the [ __ ] oh my God wait I have a compass now so that is North okay so I got to go south and around this see if I can find it back oh this might no no only those who give in at least a little can see this through give in at least a little interesting do someone live here feel like I've been up there though maybe not is this another one of those respawn points I got to check yes okay cool cool cool so North and not East yeah this way oh here this this this I think I need the a for here yeah yes having a lot of fun with this one I had a feeling that if I went forward I wouldn't be able to return but I knew I had to continue YOLO Oh I thought I was going down a slide here all right let's check it out the damp air mixed with the smell of mold made it hard to breathe the passage got Tighter and Tighter on every step I eventually had to crawl to get through but I did get through as the fresh air filled my lungs again I was relieved at first but then I realized I was still in the middle of a forest slightly different looking Forest but yep as lost as ever slightly different whoa that scared me oh my God I was just not ready for that my God just a door calm down all right a letter a letter I wouldn't want to be the person who took this photo I don't know what I'm really looking that but doesn't look friendly if you reading this I am truly sorry I hope I'm wrong and you never end up in here but my gut tells me otherwise even if you're not who I think you are you're going to need all the help you can get I call this meon medson P meso meso hold up hold up we got this hold up hold up how to pronounce um here M and met okay met okay I got this easy easy first try [ __ ] um I call this Metson P like in the old fairy tales it literally translates to Forest cover I'm guessing you were in the woods when you suddenly notice you no longer where he thought you were yep that's how I got here can't still reading you can't stay still reading for long so I'll cut this short uh there is a hideout of mine nearby I also a Finn most definitely not no I'm Dutch um where was I there's a hideout of mine nearby east of here find it keep your guard up it's not safe here I've left you more info but I need to scatter it so it doesn't put it together also use different codes from time to time for the same reason I don't know if it's enough but I have to try I have an escape plan but I hope I'm not here anymore when you are maybe we can get out of the way get out the same way good luck grandfather strange who is this letter for for me this is not a trick I need all the help I can get such a pretty [Music] game oh I'm getting a Spam message on my phone nice mandatory customs fees my ass oh my microphone is [ __ ] isn't it all right okay things should be better again four deaths wow that is not bad not bad at all all right we're going to need that what are you a messenger of arabos no it cannot be you're not yet like those who worship her first to bend were our Spears and after that our knees the one so mighty turned into slaves now I alone speak for my people in this eternal Darkness I'm cursed to keep our secrets forever if it is your OAS you seek our magic might help you more I cannot tell for I'm cursed all right sacrifice some of your Sor do an alter to regain your lost Maxum oh maybe no we're fine we're still fine you want this no I I think that's a no like it cooked let remember that's there there there's there's more I think yep that where it came from no this just lead back into the forest before summer serpents gathered to hold their trials they settled their Affairs and planned for the summer the Serpent's trial Stone was passed around they bit their marks on it as a signature CU medium rare gotcha fall and prey to the teeth of time here shall stay as filth and grime okay it don't know if that's all supposed to help or this is a way out do I want to get out that's the question I feel like I don't want to go away here what is this I feel like I don't want to go out yet [ __ ] can I get back whoopsie that sucks no that's the save points [Music] three all right three cubes I think also just lead out Brave of free there's a stapped soul here Dunston please be careful the eyes are always watching can't leave while they are watching please be careful the eyes are always watching oh they are huh hold up hold up hold up oh know if I'm going to find a cube in there though let's fully explore this area because I feel like I'm God there's so many ways I can go shiny for me the hardest thing in getting lost was being alone even after learning that I was actually in a real nightmare and that I could die or never get out all I could think of was my wife Miranda and our son Elijah it's such a cliche but being trapped made me incredibly aware of how empty my life would be without them I was thankful and Afraid as hell that I might not see them again give me that um wow there's so many ways to go it's very confusing Stitch it up there must be a cube somewhere here let's go we found one of the cubes there might be in here no I would like that though serpent thingy before summer servers gather to hold the trial to set of their Affairs and plan for the summer so what only open during summer I would like another Cube I need one more I think I've checked everywhere and I'm not seeing one cuz this is number three so I assume it means you got to find three of those cubes might be wrong I don't know got to go soon though I was actually going to sleep a bit early and then go a bit longer again [Music] tomorrow yeah I'm a bit stuck anyway gosh darn it kind of don't want to stop what time is it it's only 1 expect that worse um yeah I'm going to go to bed for now I'm just going to be a smart guy been streaming for almost six hours so it's enough it's enough um I'll be back tomorrow I'll be back to left is that where I have to go I got to I got to go though uh 

THE HEILWALD LOOPHOLE:
game number 12 uh do we want hat bobbin on let's leave it on for now and if it's really annoying we can always turn it off I don't know much about this game I know it's a pixelated horror game with very good reviews so I'm quite excited I think according to the refs a lot of people played it around 5 hours so I'm expecting it to be around that let's Dive Right In and let's see what it is it's supposed to be really scary so let's go new game guided mode let you know when you miss something this is recommended no hand holding here you have to do some exploring we'll go to guide it I've have we've done enough games that that's been on Explorer mode now lastly I'd like to say one more thing remember that this is the beginning of a new era a new era of medical research starting right here in the high world clinicum and thus I set myself one Golden Rule and it is a really should all heat as well no one dies at H we must always fight a better or at the very least a different option no one dies at highwall someone said to be how loophole is a Dutch for butthole I would believe them well I think it's German now for butthole yeah it's not a Dutch for but hole I know that much okay feels like I'm playing like a like a murder house or something oh yeah oh yeah we are so turning off head oh my God yeah that's much better could be interesting just a bunch of boxes oh okay uh hold on let me check my phone real quick um hello ominous I wonder what they're storing here do you know oh wow hey hello hi sir what are you doing what are you doing here area is absolutely off limits

sir how are you doing it landed on youo yeah it did now now I'm thinking we just started this we just started this like like for five seconds we could do that one hour if you go still we can do it we can do it do this first okay we'll do this first then yo what's up Jimmy how was Hano it was quite easy wasn't too bad bad okay it wasn't easy um but it wasn't paper dolls too don't have a seat please make this quick you seem quite lost don't even want to know you to be frank never seen you on the station but the voice is so annoying one thing I can do for you where are you what the [ __ ] holy [ __ ] after running into Dr Randol he offers to help you out although his suggested treatment is not quite what you imagined he wants to remove your liver obviously well my liver is [ __ ] anyways take it take it big documents the howood clinicum welcomes Joseph Randolph he used to take the role of Chief doctor apparently there were a lot of applicants how did he managed to get the job I wonder okay Hano was all right but the the shitty thing about Hano was the boss fights the boss fights just don't make sense why do I have hatbob on again what the [ __ ] game wait miss anything locked can I not get through scary what the [ __ ] is [Music] this what is going on Randolph's office oh it's like a oh okay that's interesting it's like a fast travel uh okay and we're back here oh my God it turns hat Bop on every [ __ ] time just a bunch of boxes yeah we're all the way back here okay bunch of empty syringes maybe there are unused ones around here maybe over there he scared the crap out of me oh God is he going to do it again oh he is I think we might want some syringes first okay maybe not I don't know we talk to him again where are you going none of your goddamn business I don't know where I'm going actually [ __ ] where are you going what the [ __ ] am I doing guys come confidential documents I lost [Music] him mostly junk [Music] okay somehow made it to his office must have been a nightmare to go through what could be so important that require this many documents dude [ __ ] final how about you read it empty syringes has to be an unused one [Music] somewhere is this 4K it is 8k actually 8p 8 pixels [Music] oh my god dude this place is absolutely huge [Music] Oh Where Are You Jesus it's quite concerned about your behavior you appear paranoid and AC try to aving his eight he plans to accommodating you in the prison temporarily what the [ __ ] dude where are you [Music] [Music] going what are you going oh that's a nice prison door is open what's this the how clinicum says goodbye to frederck erm an article about the old Chief doctor signing sounds like he was quite beloved hello oh my God this is so annoying hello downstairs it's locked locked locked yep it really is a horror game no hold [Music] up uh-oh I escape prison yeah I have to go back to randol's office bit of a loop makes sense but the name of the game okay I guess we we're doing the right thing where are you going God that's so annoying [Music] down okay we lost him again no oh [ __ ] oh my God okay been here been here try to go down again I guess or is he going to jump me where are you going okay he uh he is going to jump me okay I guess just all right so we can't go that [Music] [Music] way oh the jump scar really hurt my shoulder man God damn oh God hold up Tik Tok I'm gonna have to restart my stream real quick hold up Tik Tok I'll be back here we go there we go okay this game on Tik Tok how blue no other games okay [ __ ] my Tik Tok live studio just completely borked I think I was still

keeps on resetting it hi sir where are you going yeah yeah it was Arna Arna said it where are you [Music] anesthetics can I use that on [Music] him what have you done I'll take that why is there is that your um you know oh never mind um uh where am I so now I should be able to go down hold up though I haven't seen any doors with key cards it's this loophole yeah okay right that makes sense there we go oh sh calm down he might wake up okay think I made it through while scouring through the offices storage room you discover some leftover anesthetics you don't care if they're expired all you want to do is get rid of Dr Randol and whatever sick treatment he has in mind for you does you manage to escape into the sick Ward okay the sick Ward level two baby um hello oh God settings head poop off what's this how well clinicum oh place used to have a good reputation what happened I don't know man like they're taking your kidney and [ __ ] so I guess that's what happened sure looks in fighting yeah kind of does not linger here for too long oh hi this could be interesting that doesn't sound right they must be on some kind of drug we're free a sedative Maybe where's the doctor guess I'm the doctor now sounds like these patients really need help this place does not look clean what's this looks like a plug and it's glued shut what is going on I have no idea what is this crowbar wouldn't be a horror game there wasn't a crowbar hello It's oddly unsettling like I know it's a pixelated game but it's still scary what the [ __ ] is that oh my God what the [ __ ] is that [Music] hi

in enjoy not having ads that's amazing uh yep I finished paper dolls too and after that we also finished hanako so um we did it we're we're we're changing the the game a bit though because paper dolls 2 was not possible if I didn't use a guide as much as I did um so now from now on if I use a guide we're going to have to there's some punishments involved like I have a wheel of of punishments I'm going to have to spin it if I ever have to use a guide again where the hell am I oh turn off hat Bob again yeah it makes sense I was using a lot I was using the guide a lot well actually not not not that much but did like at least four times in paper dolls where the [ __ ] do I go this was a 5 hour game I don't know I think so I haven't really checked I just looked at the people that play this uh and left the refie they all had around 5 hours played so that's how I think it might be a 5H hour game I I think that means maintenance that has a voltage warning yeah but I can't get in there what

you you should not have messed with nuran she's usually known for her great patience and kindness she too has her boundaries all you had to do was wait for her to return was that really really too much to ask I guess so yeah oh my god oh I have to do this again oh I'm back I'm in prison back in prison so maybe that's what we have to do we just wait what if we just listen to her upgrade it to a sweet [Music] sweet electros shock W what [Music] is we still got to do stuff in the sick part right that kick was personal holy [ __ ] that's what I've been hearing all that time I heard like a giant

somewhere else maybe the the key card is the item it's the key card ah okay I think this I think I'm starting to kind of understand this game they're all little Loops right that's why it's called the loophole I'm sorry I'm sorry I'll go I'll go I'll go I'm sorry so later we come back with another item okay so we okay so we have a key card I don't know where to use that I think it was in the S ward

out and then will I still have the key card I've seen that purple key card door [Music] somewhere but where did I see [Music] that must have been in here then where was [Music] that what if I talk to him does is it oh he's gone okay n maybe I don't know was it this side no it wasn't in here I've seen it somewhere though what the [ __ ] it was when Dr House caught me that's what I seen it can I teleport out I want to do the I think outside is one of the teleporters this one I think it was the area when Dr Hower caught me I went down and I think over there I could use a key [Music] card yes

despite all this you've made it into the library not many people manag to do this nowadays how was moved most of his books up to the attic and locked this place up seeing that you're here now and you've helped me find Gregory I thought it would only be fair to help you out however I can I'm not leaving these walls though aler might still be lurking around here what about the meal slot though another plug [Music] H I don't see anything here he's gone what would that say now oh there he is hi hello see that thing over there see how there slide all kinds of documents in there I don't know probably anything deed extra important something maybe you can find something similar d just put it in that spot I don't know what will happen but it can't be bad if house are used to themselves right item of knowledge okay all right we just got to find more two more to be exact I think those are the the important documents we find found at the beginning at least I haven't seen them in a while there's really nothing else here this side let me just go outside oh how do I get out of here now oh that's going to be interesting here [ __ ] how do I get out of here now not here cuz I fell through that roof oh H oh just that side is stuck okay okay look around here yeah found a toilet here um okay let's go do the cafeteria I guess I guess that that's where I want to go now there's also still stuff in the courtyard there's still stuff in the bath [Music] house still stuff in the electroshock [Music] Ward I think this is our best bet we have to um find spices where the [ __ ] is birthday boy nothing wait what the [ __ ] oh right there we see him rolling [Music] around this game is so weird I love it [ __ ] amazing um hold on is the rest actually locked or yep I guess so cuz the birthday boys said we had to sneak up behind them oh [ __ ] this way well we don't really have to spice this yet right 30 going to happen to me in a few months too is it always the same garlic powder paprika powder and rosemary I'm writing this down garlic powder fre Rosary okay let's not get caught this time Rosemary k [Music] I still need garlic powder where the [ __ ] is that it's not [Music] here [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] okay in here garlic powder okay now we sneak up behind him [Music] there that was close holy [ __ ] [Music] hello oh I think I did it I don't okay that was dumb that

__ ] double checking that was stupid where the hell am I all right okay I know how it works now [Music] all my friends are at the Blink 182 show and I was supposed to go there but I sold my tickets because of reasons and now I I'm having that that giant [ __ ] fomo it's all right though like I can't complain I'm going to see Blink 182 in about two weeks in Las Vegas [Music] so it's fine but I

way this the right way down [ __ ] how do I get back now okay prison that's fine I don't know why I clicked on that I got a p though hold up [Music] um let's try again think all right yeah yeah yeah yeah down here Prison [Music] Break um this way I can see why people spend about 5 hours on this game now I can see it where was it there this [Music] way like how it just disappears if you go through it fast enough all right let's see what we need and just try one by one take it slow Rosemary nut mag and chili starting here with rosemary don't you [ __ ] season me don't you [ __ ] season me that's it I think just the nut magc I [Music] think don't [ __ ] this up [Music] now don't you [ __ ] season me that's it that should be [Music] it what the [ __ ] also how what is this like can we talk about this it's that weird kid at the birthday [Music] party was [Music] coming [Music] and season it wait we had nut Mac chili and rosemary it's all gone here right [Music] what the [ __ ] did that do it wrong [Music] huh here's your [ __ ] there's nothing but F super on the menu thank you thank you thank you thank you there's only one [Music] thing I just had to sit down after hearing so much at sar's Infamous fly super you finally get to taste it and it even surpassed your expectations it is truly the most foul thing anyone could ever think of coning concocting you cannot take the foul Sten and horrible taste for long and pass out on the spot that's just great and we're back in the courtyard I guess I got a birthday crown and a document criticize of Randle research paper and list obvious mistakes okay so that's two more I think those are both items yeah cafeteria is done we still have the bath [Music] house still something in the library we needed two more things that was in

don't think it's [Music] here look around in the bath house what if I don't get undressed what if I let him catch me he never caught me what what is he going to do if he catches me I think that's what I'm going to do um this way I think hello all right a quick shower boom he's still there what happens when I go to him again it's going to tell me about the C again yeah I have that key now there's

front door the cat have managed to get batteries out okay yeah that uh [ __ ] sucks man I am never getting a Smart Lock [Music] hello we have to Corner him somewhere the corner in [Music] there all

do I need a red key card where the [ __ ] do I need a red key card I honestly do not know going to say the same [ __ ] all right let's uh go look around think we might be done with this place was there anything here no that's the pooper I think I'm done here yes complete all paths in the Houser Library so that this is all done we have the courtyard bath house the electros shock Ward and the courtyard maybe in the courtyard then because I can't remember a locked gate in the yeah in the bath house or in the electroshock Ward oh here we go wow okay okay that was fast right that yeah this is new [Music] hello what the [ __ ] oh um what the [ __ ] oh you have my Tik Tok stream open on my drive home is it a bit um watchable cuz I can't really test it myself but it seems fine I haven't had any complaints yeah this game has very annoying sounds oh my God this is scary chat hold me okay that that's good info because I can lower it on TiK ToK by a mile wait I have a crowbar I can open this no no okay this is going to this is scary something in there hello oh God I don't like this somehow you keep showing up on your mind for you page but that's because you follow me right ti ti tities me yep that's how it's supposed to be yeah I'm like really whing myself out now so I'm I'm covering every platform because I need 11 more followers for the 2K on twitch so I'm trying everything man it's so hard to get followers on Twitch lately it's crazy and I'm not really playing games that people look up you know I'm playing the most obscure [ __ ] nobody knows about so it also makes sense if I want 11 followers I could play ROBLOX for an hour I guess what's up ARA it says 2K yeah because it rounds up it it rounds up yeah it's um 1989 to a follower and well thank you I appreciate that where the [ __ ] am I thanks dude Subs have been going nice we got 20 Subs again we had 26 yesterday I think so we lost a few but that's normal how you doing Arya partner incoming I don't think I'll ever get partner which is fine I'm having fun I'm having fun that's all that matters I am uh not having fun right now though because I don't know where to go yeah I would love to um pursue YouTube a bit more because YouTube has been growing fast while I'm not even doing anything on it I just post my stream stuff and I'm already at like 120 subscribers on YouTube so I gained like 60 plus this month hold up look at this look at this this is the difference between twitch and other platforms right um go to YouTube Studio I mean most I got out of YouTube are just the clips I guess but if I go to Analytics now look at this [ __ ] that's crazy that's 14,000 fuse 135 what hours watched and 50 subscribers in 28 days it's crazy but it's nobody really watches my streams see that's all low but it's the clips it's the yeah the shorts that are really doing it it's fun though it's fun to finally see some growth on a platform again because on on Twitch you're just stuck I can pull it it's been a while a long while [ __ ] this long while of only being able to watch as I went up in flames they did not seek my counsel any longer quite the opposite new platform you mean kid they try to silence me no [ __ ] way I'm going to stream on that piece of [ __ ] platform but now you are here J dist okay I must understand that I cannot let you leave here unless you show don't be afraid I'm not your enemy are you well perhaps perhaps a part of me is I don't trust you wait what do you want me to do oh can you hear them ancient words Stone to surface items for those that follow study them closely three one can't do it I respect the hardwind scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow so one is like what share two is over treatment therapeutic nihilism warm sympathy and understanding outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist drug jez this going to help me in any way there he is again those cold eyes staring into the darkness BL judge and you okay you shall be his witness his eyes ah these are all the doctors and [ __ ] share knowledge share knowledge that's this guy okay hold up let's go back what's this game about it's a really fun buzzly kind of game um you have lots of different areas and once you go there you it's like Groundhog Day it's it's a loop and in every Loop you find items that you can take out of the loop and then use that item in another loop to find something else and you keep on progressing through them it's really nice I will apply for the benefit of the sick all measures and only those required avoiding those twin traps of over treatment and therapeutic nihilism two is over treatments hold up let me I got to write this down over treatment to thetic nihilism who is that art and medicine as well as science that warms sympathy and understanding that's the that's the girl warrants sympathy understanding outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist drug what's over here a dead ant there we go that there is a four I'll prevent the Seas I don't know about this but I remember what was one we haven't found one here share share such knowledge that is the librarian that is the librarian so we've we've met different characters in the game and right now we have to kind of connect the dots like the numbers to the the people you see here so this is the swim guy I honestly don't know she is warmed and sympathy so she's number three I think prent the Seas maybe or I don't know man this is actually hard he is too here's one no wait who's this wait one two 4 3 wait there's more oh my God this is it reads each do their own yet what is a broken o I don't know who that is honestly oh God it's so dark in here dude is this your final answer let's stus suppose it's a good start but think again okay that's not it wait there's 1 two 3 four 5 six oh my God I don't know what to do each to their own yet what good is a broken oath I don't know um sh knowledge she's definitely the that guy right I don't really remember this guy that is the doctor and I think it yeah I think that's over treatment this is I think this is the chef honestly don't know should I just look this up we we're going to have to spin the wheel if I look this up though it does have a AA yeah we don't like to talk about this one so so pretty on the outside it has souls corrupted long before the I've tried to keep you away from it what not that I work particularly well we can only hope that one day he gets why he soes you're not giving me any hints here okay it's not okay she knew how to make us Al she knew how to get through to people fortunate skills possess especially profession see that is um the kind of therapy she practiced was unnecessary and cruel to roast and you wouldn't be wronged in Jud for but even with those things in mind she was able to take away some of the pain okay where's my notepad but maybe that's over treatment oh yeah it was already on there dear hle trout oh hidle trout right that's a nurse so many years always L but never without fall I saw her two things things she shouldn't have done she was often frustrated she wanted silence she wanted but since all those little suffering Ms around her went all there she went down the wrong path F thees I think that might actually be right voice remains quiet okay it's the library guy man of much knowledge yeah see knowledge I'm so sure about that one so much in fact that he open his own well you saw what happened to him it's so unfortunate he was aware of the events and driven by fear and the world to protect his collection he moved as much as some ke say okay what a Sor creature you saw for yourself don't to boil for all eternity okay that is the shf own flesh is poison to those least deserving how did he end up likeing that the chef I don't I really don't know I feel like everything is kind of right no you're not right is this your final answer well probably not suppose it's a good start but think again this is uh yeah this is very annoying I might might look up a guide but we just said that every time I have to use a guide I'm going to have to spin the wheel of punishment do I really want to do that is that going to be worth it I could look it up for you no no no that's not fair that's not fair let me let me hold up let me go back once more this is a really really really annoying puzzle you're uh that there is Art to medicine as well as science and that warmth sympathy and understanding May outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist drug so this one does not use does not use drugs or knives so I think that's the chef the knowledge is easy that is the librarian I will apply for the benefit of the sick all measures and only those required avoiding those twin traps of overt treatment oh so no overtreatment that's that's a doctor yeah we got a librarian that is the chef we got a doctor and then we got four to prevent the Sease I think that might be the Mr swimmy uh swimmy swim okay so hold up so you uh prevent the Sease you are a doctor free you also a doctor so you're also free you're a doctor but he does use drugs wait two no two doctors is two you might be free though hold up let's try this oh you've been quite observant indeed [ __ ] yes I was so close to looking up a guide continue your journey oh thank [ __ ] dude all right let me uh close my guide um nice let me close um my notepad and where's Tik Tok did I close Tik Tok Tik Tok are you still here there's Tik Tok okay I did it Y what time do you stream I don't really have I can

snacks you didn't bring the snacks what weather it's been raining like this for days with no end inside it's kind of suiting though don't you think uh I guess have you seen that massive buky building over there that's the new dental facility Commission by Dr Randall it's more like a giant torture chamber to me though I mean it doesn't even have Windows they made this look like an unin fighting as possible not no windows does it have Linux truly ruined the park moves for me I used to sit here and talk with my patients but no one really wants to come here anymore completely understandable of course especially because of those weird ventilation shs oh my lights incredibly noisy I don't even know what's releasing the steam in the first place okay my lights are turning off and that's because normally this is my bedtime so automatically my U lights will start to dim and eventually go out because I I should be working tomorrow but I have days off so I'm going to have to turn this off right now automations go to sleep we're never going to sleep anymore we're also not waking up no let me turn it back on there we go give me my Hospital lights back resume all right okay let's check out that building uh don't really know what oh this building oh that is the the H Dental I make okay stay hydrated cheers expansive concrete monstrosity that is the new dental facility Towers above you you're not sure if this is a good idea but you do not see any other way so you step [Music] inside the dental facility uhoh uhoh did you floss won't be chatting as much now that's all right man get some sleep do you have an appointment um no you think you don't let me check ah looks like you do have an appointment right about now wow you coincidence I didn't even know that isn't that curious issued

good I I want to leave I didn't floss okay I did not floss I am not ready to go to the dentist all right um I have no choice than to sit and wait I guess hello and this it hello oh oh hi hello there you may call me sine all right the girl from smile Dental examination evaluation or reparation iume as issued by Dr Randall of course you are kept you waiting for long enough so let's get going she is horribly creepy and weird she walks like she okay sorry holy [ __ ] she walks like she farted and a a turd came out and that turd is like sliding down her leg now and she's trying to find a toilet yeah okay this doesn't really seem like a dental facility um building is very new and still somewhat under construction yeah I can tell we have noticed already but of course it's all for the most efficient betterment of your patience I don't trust this what if I no no no no no no no no all right yeah yeah yeah okay I'll get my teeth checked fine go no way out there's no way out oh my God here we are please have a seat and we'll start the procedure might already know we begin examining your dental condition actually it's more like a cardio thing for your teeth and jaw that's what she's said after all strong curly whites are so important let me grab the equipment you guys have dentist appointments coming up might want to close your eyes here this this can't be good this this cannot be good I don't trust it where is she hi what the [ __ ] is that fits like a glove any discomfort yes a lot of course not uhhuh right so this thing will basically apply a lot of pressure to your jaw and Inter turn Teeth did you know that the jaw is the strongest muscle in the entire body amazing isn't it surprising as well you should have no problem resisting this thing one more thing oh God what's this happening 30 lb of pressure [Music] nice I'm I'm dead 200 lb of pressure what good does this [Music] do seems like a normal dentist that's it to me honestly bit of a mess didn't we but that's all right next up is reparation procedure oh that's just okay I was told Dr Rand would see to that personally have a nice day he will be here soon what the [ __ ] is going on Dr Randolph oh I think I got

ritual candle go back out now yeah I can I heard you should be down at the [Music] auditorium oh right yes this is the auditorium you hi I'm a terrible person what did I do AR is in danger I I was always jealous of AR since the very first year she was always the center of the group having no hesitation to talk to anyone I was there sitting alone being awkward not being able to socialize when he called when we called hanako son I couldn't help it picture Arie so probably why hanako son appeared on us I'm so sorry I deserve to die all my fault boo [ __ ] who all right yanako is not real I'm a terrible person oh [ __ ] I got to get through this again yes okay you go cry in here I'm getting out of here wait come on I'm I'm just I just have to check because what if one of these have gold in them you know what if the last two oh and that also gives you an achievement so okay this say nothing nothing and a battery so that was useless hi I have two ritual candles and a computer room key which is the black one oh [ __ ] it's late it really is I kind of just want to [ __ ] find a safe I can't quit now I haven't saved I could leave the game open till tomorrow maybe but but it's really late I need sleep I don't know where the hell I'm going to find a computer room computer room there we go oh [ __ ] what's that guess what the [ __ ] oh oh what the [ __ ] I think she turns some off or something y Argan didn't know you were still here good night sir thanks for hanging for as long as you always [Music] do I did it scream she had no head wow you were so smaria that is those are the real questions how did she scream okay everything is on what what do we do now like wait for the power bill oh okay that's not a strange poster that actually makes sense so this one off or maybe on okay that might actually be on yeah okay it's the other way around okay so one two wait hold up I'm stupid second on the rest off okay here am I doing this right I no no wait I keep on forgetting is a DOT on or off I don't even know what I'm doing now a DOT is probably on right so see I have it the other way around dots on this is on on on okay so we got okay these two tables are done this one too come on this should be it stupid puzzle okay maybe it is the other way around then yeah can we just call it this is [ __ ] so black is off off off off off off off off on off off off off on off on off off off off off oh okay that was it hello 3 F master key Oh I thought that was gold okay I'll use that heal though um I'll use it gold okay whatever we we'll go to 3F Jesus Christ you can't stop playing this game I am a 3F right so I think this leads to the no I'm not oh what the [ __ ] that scar [ __ ] out of me I opened this with a key I [Music] think why are there flowers pedals here okay let's try to remember that yes yes yes yes yes guys I am so going to bed 6 hours to alarm or you yeah I don't want to sleep in all day tomorrow either actually I could do I want that I don't know look let me check now we still have a ways to go we still have a ways to go so I'm just going to save you guys got plans tomorrow on a Sunday or well today hello by the way I'm so sorry I can't help you with anything see one of those monsters again I won't be able to move what are you going to do tomorrow all right I saved I'm just going to let the game running all right all right all right all right I'm going to go all right let's finish this I don't know how long we still have left but aillard game can't be too long I guess the sound in this game is so horrid okay yeah I might want to lower that again hold up that is too loud volume mixer uh anako cool that'll have to deal so um what do we have we have the classrooms key we have two ritual candles cafeteria storage and the 3F so let's go to 3F you know I don't mind this game as much as people made me [Music] um well you know there were two specific people in chat who absolutely hated this game so I really thought I was going to be having a very very bad time but it's not too bad like I've really had worse I I wasn't talking about you not at all okay we need the pre F master key oh god oh oh oh I forgot about that [ __ ] that's [ __ ] I can't get away from that anyway does this boss the game I hope it does I hope it does uh biger wheel we have amnesia debunker plus one it's some two now a what if that's the next game no I I really want a really good game after this I deserve it what the hell is this I hate looking in the mirror the only people who look in the mirror often are those who think they are cute it's not for someone ugly like me why am I so ugly I want it to be born with a little more than a normal face just a little more is fine the world is not fair wish there was no such thing as a face then everyone wouldn't have to be judged by whether they are cute or not that's funny I like that idea let's all stop having faces guys um your face Derm is most of your life it's possible to live oh [ __ ] janitas thanks for the prime gamer sub appreciate it thanks man God damn just like that thank you very much appreciate it um it's possible to live with my face exposed in such a world that's sad is that the screaming girl that's been uh is that hanako maybe thanks enjoy the the the no um no ads let me pull up Tik Tok too because I'm live there too hi YouTuber Jen welcome in I'm not reading Tik Tok chat too much much by the way so I'm late there come on over to Twitch okay what's Happening Here oh wait what oh god math so okay I'm going to need this so I'm going to make a screenshot and then we'll do math later okay what the [ __ ] is this what the [ __ ] is an ofuda I have no idea oh [ __ ] okay we have to do this now all right so okay um that's 50 let me see uh okay so this is probably easy but I I um I use I skipped school a lot okay so 21 25 - 20 56 is 69 sorry um doesn't make sense wait wait make make this make sense guys what the [ __ ] [Music] um that's not half of that is 128 so half minus 4 um 65 no that's weird Hold Up 2 one 2 one no no okay [ __ ] um okay there's seven days in between every one of them 48 18 trying to figure this puzzle out here no idea what I'm doing huh wait um oh doesn't make sense plus 20 56 2090 maybe no oh for [ __ ] sake Ro forcing this is not going to work is it are we going to have to use a guide already no no no no no I got this i got this 2084 didn't I just try that I feel like I did yeah I did that's not it oh God am I doing um so okay started but the difference between okay let's do like 2056 minus 24 that's 32 okay um no Yes [Music] actually okay times no it doesn't make sense what the [ __ ] I can't figure this out um I feel stupid now times 69 is 34 for n it's not 2090 is it I'm so confused guys if it's not any of these [Music] then and there nothing in between those [Music] numbers which is weird huh so it's nothing in the 20 in the 22100 that's weird how the [ __ ] okay are we going to um we could ask a friend of mine his name is uh chat GPT if 7 is 1,24 and 14 is 2 2056 then what is 21 H yo what's up stas hanako has one I'm um I'm having a headache here damn it are you good at maths I need someone who's good at math not allowed to use a guide you screwed yeah I think I am playing around to a calculator here but okay not condemned hey who knows who knows uh after this game we uh got to move to the next one + 2 + 2 9 two hold up so if I do 21 three two no no hold up this is weird 2100 I think it's a lot different than this though I think it's like a lot higher we can try it out because I've been trying to Bruce Force this but it doesn't really do anything right I think it's a lot different I have a really weird number on my screen on my calculator right now n this this not going to make sense right 92 6 no what the [ __ ] I think we might actually have to spin the punishment wheel already guys wait why is my green screen [ __ ] oh it's because of the green light this game gives you look at that [ __ ] do I really need a guide already I don't want to use a guide hold up that make sense to me so hold up like 21 let's start at the beginning again 2125 minus 20 56 oh 69 it doesn't matter doesn't matter it's different than this no um maybe the the cross off numbers have something to do with it so cross off four hold up so okay so Cross Four that makes it 102 28 * 2 56 okay and then 256+ 8 or minus8 1496 it doesn't matter it it doesn't make sense to me there's no [ __ ] way no oh [Music] God maybe I just have to move on First [Music] and not worry about this yet because I don't [Music] know find the code into the internet I'm not allowed then I have to use the the wheel then he will suffer forever no I got this one two [Music] guys I don't [ __ ] know let me try something that let me show you guys what I'm my Trin of thought here but oh God let me show you my train of thought here a bit where's my calculator right here this this is what I'm trying to [ __ ] figure out here let's okay I have an idea look four is scratched off so we do like 1 plus two three five + 6 + [Music] 7 we're on to something that's 24 9 + 10 + [Music] 11 [Music] 12 20 32 so see this is where I'm losing it plus 14 oh [ __ ] you're right I missed uh 14 okay okay okay okay okay you're right so 15 + 16 + 17 + 19 + 20 + 21 just 108 so one oh [ __ ] hold on oh my God one oh my God big brain holy [Laughter] [ __ ] oh God okay I went to parts of my brain that didn't know exist good [ __ ] good [ __ ] good [ __ ] Tik Tok thank for the gifts for the Roses oh oh I was so close to [ __ ] just just pulling up a guide okay we got a rooftop key see I knew it it had to do something with the cross of [Music] numbers okay we did it got a new key let's go to the rooftop I guess oh sounds where the hell did I go to the rooftop where was that it's very annoying what the [ __ ] okay found it what's my how's my heal health I'm not I don't want to use it yet not yet I got that key somewhere [Music] here is that someone's [Music] lunch offering table candle oh okay I need one more candle oh nice oh yeah we can apply that right away actually let's have a good look around here see if I can find some gold maybe gold would be nice although I seriously doubt it Sophia's lunch yeah I think so too um okay I don't think I'm going to find anything else here I just need one more candle so let's see what we have cafeteria storage and an oooda I don't know what that is and a microphone what the hell do I do with the microphone this was the library I think I just have to go to the second floor broadcasting room oh probably have to use the microphone there no I was just here I was just here nothing else right no okay um did we read this oh that is a supporters thingy let's go down to the second floor I don't like the sound of [Music] that I'm fulling batteries oh no no no no she really sneaks up on you that's the cat we've seen it I don't think I've ever seen that um cafeteria storage we've done this puzzle [Music] yesterday game give me something storage might just be in the basement [Music] and oh right this is the place from yesterday with the spider what the [ __ ] this is closed oh can't use anything here no try to remember that we find some weird it item we can't use use it there [ __ ] where is the storage room won't let me pass can I give you something to let me pass a microphone oh this okay you're welcome I guess maybe I need another one this game would be so nice if it had a map it's not moving I can't pick it back up either so I have no idea oh oh oh you're we an absolute [ __ ] okay we uh we know what to do with those we happen to find another one who then would yeah now it's like 90% no more like 69% I don't know I it's the TP typical it it's we've had so many of those typical run and hide from monsters and try to solve puzzles horror games too many of them lately this is exactly what I was afraid for cuz you know a lot of horror games just be like that but this is uh this is a prime example right here anyone in the toilets here maybe yeah how was your lunch uh sopia did you have fun paper dolls 2 is over you should be happy I am like it it's not going to get worse than the paper dolls I think maybe I don't know there's also a lot of games on the list that I really don't know anything about you're such a cun read all [Music] that okay where's the where's the cafe then where's the cuz it must be downstairs right arts and crafts room [Music] infirmary and craft infirmary so many snacks went a bit out of hand I saw the the spicy noodles in there enjoy those eat them on stream I don't know if it's the two times you got if it is do it on [Music] stream I hate this game I have no clue what I'm supposed to [Music] do yeah I like two days ago I think I spent almost €40 on snacks and it's it's all gone already I ate all of it uh so um that that's all because I stopped smoking right and now I'm trying to maybe it is less expensive if I just start smoking again because I'm eating away more money than I did with cigarettes you know it's just saying teachers office principal's office yeah we already used the three f1's though somehow we still have the key oh it's a master key hold up it's a master key so that would make sense if it has multiple uses right it's a key for everything so any doors here what is that no there is no way I I can avoid [Music] that no been been there let's find some lock doors okay so can can't I use the master key okay so the the fact that this is a moner key is a lie oh okay there we go there we go there we go that's good offering flower um where was that we found a place with flowers [ __ ] I'm not going to I'm not ever going to find that back but okay so okay good good good good good we did need the fre of key cuz it's expensive as [ __ ] dude groceries nowadays are so expensive it's actually crazy it's so [ __ ] insane dude we have to eat [ __ ] soup today guys cuz there's just wow I found it okay we follow the catchup don't you dare follow me um okay it went in here oh no no no no I really don't want to die like I really don't and God damn it okay broadcast broadcasting room good [ __ ] let on this floor [Music] right I think it was else we can also go use um piece of paper on the doll which I think was also on this floor maybe the second I hate how you have to stand still to um recharge your stamina oh wait oh wait I thought we were on the third floor but we I wasn't damn it broadcasting room it's probably where we have to use a microphone missing microphone oh oh [ __ ] Jesus hold oh my god oh oh nice oh oh [ __ ] she's badly injured well I don't have anything to heal you with like I'm badly injured too I mean fix yourself damn it I can't talk to her or anything there's nothing else here should I save I think I should right yeah let's save uh well I mean we're here what's going to happen boom baby this is why are mannequins always so [ __ ] creepy oh oh oh I should have saved most likely is that a ritual candle no oh I should have saved I should have saved guys can I still go save [ __ ] I should have sa just don't die yeah just don't die [Music] what the [ __ ] do I do dude there's no way I can avoid this oh if I die we have to do everything over again we can do it faster I guess do I not have a heal anywhere here that is just brutal [Music] man that is so brutal do I give her a mannequin hat maybe oh that's so bad that's it's 45 minutes just gone 45 minutes just just gone like that let me write that down so I can cut this whole bit out of YouTube oh um one [ __ ] oh my man she is murdering me already okay so we got another boss fight and as we know boss fights in this game game are the most unclear pieces of [ __ ] so that's going to be [Music] fun enough batteries that's for sure let's look around if I can find some bandages before I get the mannequin had probably not because this game hates you [Music] okay [ __ ] it let's go might die a few times is it this one again oh it is what if I hold this charm will that save [Music] me not really thought it was one of these okay so it is different that hat yeah I tried that last time but then I died I think you get more time with the protection charm let me try yeah that's it what the [ __ ] she always hits you she always hits you where are you come here come here oh there you are hello use the ad maybe where you at there you are there nothing I can do that's so annoying hello please let this be it no that means I'm dead no I'm not dead [Music] yet what the [ __ ] I might die now I don't really get what I'm doing to be honest ah I see okay because I kept walking back she eventually regain control and that's when she charges you it's not that bad actually quite easy oh hi kind of [ __ ] up a bit because I am really low Health now where are you there you are easy easy if I only knew that 10 minutes ago could have saved me a lot of Health no no no no no you no no hello oh oh there we go all right Show Yourself show yourself please just die damn it grab some batteries or or not I mean this is right this must be right now I'm starting to doubt if I'm doing the right thing but it feels right I think game is so unclear it's going to keep on going here easier to spot whoa come on oh there there we go there we go there we go wow now give her a head no are you kidding me are you [ __ ] kidding me get some batteries okay we're full and everything nice now get the mannequin hat do this a bit quicker Now is it going to be the same again wait oh there's batteries here too why no heels heels would be nice [Music] like she's trying to poop maybe she is maybe that's the story of the game come here come here come here come here it's kind of funny how I had a dream that the next game we were playing was going to be alen wake and now it's it's not alen wake but it's the same flashlight mechanic so I guess my dream was somewhat right where the [ __ ] is she very this is going this this must be a fun game to speedrun this place is going to kill all of your runs oh God hello remember when I had like a super painful shoulder yesterday I took a nap without any pillows so my back was completely straight and it's almost completely gone now it's still there but it's so much better yes hello wow that took long hello that was close I think which one oh whoa okay I think I got her yes there we go now putot on her head you're beautiful now the last candle the last [Music] candle you're not going to give me any safes right no come on piece of gold they opened this but they're not giving me anything that is so rude all right let's get to the roof and uh put it on fire let the [ __ ] burn I mean we still got to beat hanako herself right it's one of the achievements so probably going to dive right into the next boss fight upstairs that would [Music] [Music] suck uh [ __ ] not this one I need to go up this one all right let's see what we're going to find probably a boss fight oh God I thought it was there but I'm not is that the bathroom or yeah I hate this place it's such a maze like I I can't find my way in here okay that's it all three come at the same time Bring It On not the spider though [ __ ] that all right I know what that means but is is there a gold I'm so scared okay let's go what is this oh okay where would I use [Music] this interesting that looks like it can do some [Music] damage hi you may I I really wanted to help you wonderand around looking for things that could be of any help I found this oh the basement do you also have a piece of gold so I can save that'd be [Music] great what if I follow this sound come on there must be a piece of gold [Music] somewhere yeah maybe not Maybe not maybe at the basement let's just go down

bring AR back yes are you sure you want to do that [Music] yes and ending too we left the school Yum's been trembling in fear AR's crying her eyes out we made it out scares me to think what would have happened if I failed to take AR back but Ary doesn't remember a single thing that was Ary but maybe it wasn't hanakos son she was someone that should not have been called lightly he was someone that oh I read that I was a little worried about the bully we came to curse however it seems like nothing has happened to her maybe because I defeated hanako seems to be less bullying now perhaps the bullies is fed up of it what we did might have been in vain but I wouldn't curse anyone anymore as they say curses return upon the heads of those that curse the number of people who talk about hanakosan gradually started to subside and a rumor mysteriously forgotten it never existed in the first place I haven't talked with Yumi and AR about the rumor ever since the unspoken rule amongst the three of us we wish what happened that night was only a dream now everyone is back to usual today I finally decided to go back to school then in the class the teacher entered the classroom with a girl I I'll introduce you to the new student hanako mitari immediately you may an AR turned around and looked at me at the same time my eyes Met m eyes is she saying something to me I look carefully to read her lips There Is No Escape I don't know if we have the good end here but we finished it take that Jimmy and sofhia easy game all right we're going to you guys want to fote one more time before we Spin the Wheel game by chill's Art it's not it's definitely not one of my favorite chill ass games it's it doesn't feel like a chill ass game um yeah it's my least favorite so far but still it had its moments it's a memorable one that that's for sure that's for sure can I skip this I don't think I can

PAPER DOLLS 2:
paper dolls steel I don't know what the odds are like one in 81 because there's I think there's 81 games on the wheel but it landed on paper dolls too which is probably the hardest game that's on the wheel the reason it's so hard is because it has it's a Chinese game it has puzzles in Chinese and then they translated those puzzles to English and that doesn't translate well doesn't so that's going to suck um I'm going to try to not use a guide but don't [ __ ] hate me if I do use a guide all right cuz I don't think you can't you can finish this as someone who doesn't speak Chinese without a guide I'm going to need that um I'll play on normal suitable for those familiar with horror Survival Games well I I played a few of them enemies in the mode deal medium damage and move faster the furba Furby cannot warn you of enemies yet resources are not uh scarce won't be able sorry to attain a high score in this mode I don't give a [ __ ] let's go uh stay hydrated good I got some room temperature Cola ready to go here I think this picks up right after paper dolls one oh I think it does I think it's a direct sequel yeah yeah because at the end of uh paper dolls one we unlocked the upstairs and that's where we are now quick thr an A okay it's already a bit smoother than the first one can I uh oh God that And So It Begins guys so it begins straight into puzzle um okay we got a blue dot that's great you know what that means yeah me nether don't see anything here why is this scary already excuse me I'm taking this Red Dot oh that's the the that's the Furby it's the knife look in all of paper dolls one I have no idea what the candles actually do I never knew I still don't ahuh oh God here here here it goes save zones yeah that's what I thought but it didn't work as a safe Zone last time because the candle just went to Blue when the ghost was close and he just kept on following you so I don't know if it was a safe zone or not anyway fragment of writing paper The Madam is in danger only you can help her right now this red stain must be sent to the embroidery room it is very important do not make any mistake and leak to others I knew the trap master had set do remember that you can pass through the first door in the second floor Corridor only when the bell rings at 2 a.m. oh my God okay um afterwards pass through the doors one by one with the instructions in the mid you will be safe then uh okay let's just walk around oh wow I have legs do we have lags in the first one I don't remember it's like a week go okay got another dot um another one I have a feeling one of these are going to scare me can I open this no but nice try um mild safe zones yeah I guess that's it um oh wait there we go no I want to check it oh God yeah we're going to be so stuck all night I can't wait and that's all thanks to Jimmy actually Jimmy only said I had to play paper dolls one I did it was was my fault I put paper dolls too on the wheel okay so it's kind of my fault but it's funnier to blame Jimmy so we will blame Jimmy but I will be honest about it and blame Jimmy oh God no clock hands not again guys oh I don't know who was here yesterday but during what game did we play yesterday what was the name part artifacts we had chat just going on with hand jokes because I was looking for a clock hand oh here we go you guys are starting already if if Argan if Dennis was here he they they would die probably what is it with horror games and clocks any more oh wait huh no that's the dagger oh yeah that makes sense is this uh is this like a uh is is this a Chinese clock can I take it off oh [ __ ] what oh it's a okay it's a second time all right so we have oh wait 2: a.m. right I actually put it at 2: a.m. that is definitely not it all right all right [ __ ] it let's let's read it I have no clue what's going on um I knew the Trap Master had set do you remember that you can pass through the first door and the second floor only when the bell rings okay that's quite clear um so so let's give it like this cuz you can't [ __ ] run in this game it's the same as the first game guys you can run for one second and then he's tired this game is like me [Music] IRL boom [ __ ] all right um oh God it's the same door sound too did I just I'm confused I just walked in the circle didn't I y yeah I [ __ ] did all right um I guess we need more of those small paper pieces where the hell am I going to find those though that's not going to open I can't Crouch or at least if I can I don't know how all right so hold up I'm warning you guys these puzzles are going to be so tough I need like two or three more I guess try to figure it out I checked all these right oh man it's so scary yeah nope oh there we go that's both of them hold up perfect why didn't you play it a second Jimmy I mean you should play it a second it's beautiful is that all of it oh [ __ ] no it's not let's [Music] try look again oh it's like someone's it's like a blanket I was like what the hell am I looking at no can I open these no wait did they just appear okay now I'm complete gray three times red and then blue I have no clue what that means but we'll figure it out eventually you were going to but you never did [ __ ] sorry hair stuck in Metro um wait can I just go through the door you know what the thing was with the first one the paper dolls one I didn't actually hate it I just hated a few of the puzzles and the qtees besides that I did not actually hate the game I wish I did though oh I'm so confused already the method by this must be in that letter yeah let's uh let's actually read it again Madam is in danger only you can help her right now this red stain must be sent to the embroidery room it's very important do not make any mistake and leak to others what does that even mean um I knew the Trap Master had said do you remember that you can pass through yeah okay we did that oh I got a hiccups man so annoying oh we're adding weight to Hano again uh oh let me do that real quick before I forget um Hano Hano Hano is at 8 right now okay afterwards pass through the doors one by one with the instructions in the mail blue blue blue red red red and then gray what does what does that mean oh I see that that's a blue room that's the red one I guess so red red red then blue blue blue red once another red another red and now three times blue am I am I am I that smart wow guys 200 IQ holy [ __ ] I did the first puzzle without help by the way hi Argan how you doing sir you missed a a puzzle involving clock Hands by the way oh we got an achievement okay got another match I only get those in game never never on Tinder how did you handle it oh my God here it goes again I quit how is this even locked oh I'm a thirsty boy today okay what do we have here um I don't think they eat match sticks yeah that looks vegan all right let's see what we have to do there must be a note somewhere what's this it's a wait okay I'll take that if you need hand you could have just W up so we know I could have but I didn't need a hand had enough hands yesterday I just have like 200 IQ so I don't need any help not today Chinese puzzles no biggie I got all of it don't worry about it I'm stuck I think no I haven't even started oh wait wait wait wait wait wait put it on here maybe I can't use it oh [ __ ] um walk around here I'm so not ready to be chased all [ __ ] evening in this game it's probably going to be the same as the first game right where you just constantly get chased hello okay that's part of a map the ladies quarter map okay where am I oh haven't been here yet can I open this I'm already confused um what is dong kaii is there a dong in this oh here we go oh God that's going to suck isn't it how do ick jeez nice nice perfectly timed how do I put it on the other side I don't get it I think I need a few more though like at least one more but I can't really put it on the other side so I don't get it a here we go there's more there's more this will all make sense after I'm be I'm like stuck for like 5 hours you know then it will all make sense can I that like a little stove I can open this oh my God what is this salami pepperoni licorice roots gold threat okay whatever that is because no no no that that was that was pepperoni definitely pepperoni piercing that is um definitely drugs right yeah oh my God what do I do with all of this all going I go in here oh hey I'm back here okay wait can I put something on this plate it's a little plate here some this [ __ ] some of that some of this can I combine it no that's not combining right no I can't combine [ __ ] all right let's keep on looking around we still got this oh oh oh okay I have to see that's 7 and a half and this is two so the the dosage is incorrect what what do you want about game I I thought I understood you okay so one gr is probably this right the do what the hell what do you want from me game okay I'm probably going to find a note some somewhere where this will will make sense I'm not going to find anything this game is never going to make sense who am I kidding turn that on but I don't see the point no I can hide in there good to know oh here we go a note the lady should drink a concoction for her nurse before each meal as this will stop her hallucinations for a few hours there's a medicine pot and a small stove by the medicine box boil the medicine immediately after mixing it after mixed it okay take note you must make sure she takes her medicine before her birthday party okay oh here we go here we go guys can we will it like remember that let me see let's go back hold up wait can I find some more I honestly think I have everything now what's that hello oh God I that scares me I think something's chasing me no maybe not weird weird okay can I like look at the note now I can't um what's the best way to cheat on this um I am going to make a screenshot just like that open the screenshot put it on my other screen let me see so I can still read chat all right so gold threat that's this [ __ ] that's 18 oh my God maths all right so that's 12 15 7 okay so everything okay there we go oh [ __ ] um I'm I going to get the rest now cuz the liquor rout is oh [ __ ] okay I see it's not that easy wait is it okay it is I think I don't know um cabar is 45 can we do that no Licor rout is 17 so we got 12 12 15 17 that's the lior roots um and the next one was 45 G that's 17 + 18 oh it actually says what it is in the middle that's nice [ __ ] I [ __ ] up [ __ ] up I [ __ ] up again um I got this don't worry don't worry 12 six right it's six in total so I [ __ ] up again we need definitely need that how does this work how do I get to [Music] 45 I think we need uh find something else first that's cabar right this cinear cuz I can't add this up six yeah should be more weights around I just don't know where see if I can find it 200 IQ at work you know it you know it did this boy had a nap I'm like 2011 IQ now just because I'm that sharp oh hey match Jinan dinghai y gchan are those Pokemon I think they are character relationships oh it's this [ __ ] again right okay I think they're Pokemon why do I get scary sounds locked that's locked oh here we go see there is more this is is a for G what's this I saw black shapes flickering behind Jinan as he was fixing a rope to the Skylight above the stage seeing them sent chills down my spine oh [ __ ] hold up still no monsters hey I like it okay I don't need monsters in my life I'm just chilling puzzling you know killing we're fine did someone puke on this door yes yes yes he did can I climb this probably not not the game was too cheap for that it actually wasn't it was quite an expensive game not going to lie I think it was 1650 can't believe I PID that but whatever I'm not going to lie so far I am enjoying myself but it does like throw you right into the puzzles just straight from the start that's that's still not going to help right is it how much is this 10 calm down game calm down calm down that's not annoying at all okay boom baby is that it do we just cook this [ __ ] now I think so oh yeah that that looks juicy a mind concoction it's like a cockier mind um okay so now what oh seem to have interrupted them okay sorry okay do it again crap I might have effed this up how do I get them to to talk again I'm they're probably going to say stuff I need okay I think I know what to do with this it's a drug don't drink but it's Friday St was that an auto save I just saw happen does this gu does this game have auto save that's amazing I look like a mannequin whoa what the crap is that I got so good at these QuickTime events they're not going to get me uh [Music] a that looks fast and I can only run for one second so B be attacked by Yin Ling oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh run I can't run uh excuse me trying to get away here I'm screwed I'm so screwed oh is this the safe room it is okay so light the candle so I think there's Auto saves and you can save yourself so that's not bad yeah look an actual auto save we didn't have that in the first game why would I have to hide in the safe room what's this I am not hurt okay that heals I guess empty white tiger blood bottle I can just make out the word mistress all right uh take it [Music] that's a compass so I read I was reading the reviews of this game and everyone complained about the compass because well it's in Chinese so this is going to screw me over I already know that much by using someone's blood as a medium it is possible to seal doors by creating a blood seal by comining combining the host element one of the five elements and their four pillars of Destiny also known as the eight characters of birth time what the crap compass compass compass come come come come come sorry um and applying this to location one can seal it rendering them unable to pass competitive ass I am multi streaming to TI talk I don't know how much longer I am allowed to do that if this goes on anyway to break it blood of the same person must be smeared upon it whereupon one must in succession arrange the pointer of a compass and corresponds to the host five elements eight my God Jesus look I got 200 IQ right but you need 350 to be exact eight trigrams directions I'm not even going to try to figure this out yet compass compus compus come [ __ ] [ __ ] are you guys on about I am saying it just fine Compass is just what it is all right it's not it's not that I'm Dutch and I murder some words compass that that sounds weird campass yeah that's it whoa I think he despawns if you go in that room that that's how it worked in the first game Knock Knock yeah that's definitely you can see it being locked this one too they're not behind me are you no it's the same locks uh it definitely has a hand so I guess you open these with the blood of your enemies and a compass now now I don't feel comfortable after saying not it it's the same that I can't say the number three because I can't do that you know because I'm Dutch all we can do is help um yeah I can run this way but that's not going to help right okay I can't hide in there oh God I'm cornered can you move well here we go again here we go again all right grab everything again yeah I got everything we didn't find anything on the other side there right is this where I am monster is up there slowly coming down so I can't really go that way you think I have to Juke him and go back up this this all locked paper dolls one of the few things that hurt more than a paper cut [Music] definitely wait hold up let me check something oh [ __ ] boom okay I don't know what to do there's nothing in here right now I checked I think we just got to find one of those well paper dolls just like in the first game right he's right here is he no so maybe I do have to go that way somehow fast the monster they have the same name yeah such a coincidence oh that's the safe room he going one of those locks yeah we haven't found one of those bodies yet hello wait something shiny here NOP that's just a graphical glitch okay I'm I'm just going to turn this on see if it works as a safe Zone oh there it is damn it see it turns blue and just follows you what the oh oh you are quite fast sir please don't oh yeah I'm annoyed already I'm annoyed already this game is quite something I'm never going to get rid of it oh yeah I'm screwed I'm literally screwed thanks for screwing me I got to get fast excuse me yeah I somehow I'm dead damn it what do I even do I don't get it show the nipple trick I'm also live on Tik Tok guys am I the kids St under there I can't just show my nipples oh my God okay I have I already have no clue what to actually do puzzle blood curse by using someone's blood as a medium we haven't even found someone yet so we have nothing to take blood from right uh it is possible to seal doors oh we don't need the blood by combining the host element one of the five elements and enter four pillars of Destiny eight characters of bird sign by applying this to a location yeah the green emblem the red emblem that that are sealed with blood and we can break it with the blood of the same person whereupon it must in succession arrange the pointer of the compass and correspondence to five elements then you have to do six back flips with your fingers in your ears with a sock on your right foot and the Charizard limited edition in your left hand land on your feet put your sock off put it in your mouth fart twice and then you can open the door that's that that's how I'm understanding this right now I think the Dark Charizard counts yeah this game's going to take a while you can fart on demand I wish man some people really can really do that I can't that's that's one of the skills I really want in life but no so the bottle is empty so we need to fill it with blood okay let let's look around and see if we can find someone's body I wouldn't know where but I guess that's what I have to do oh come on go go go go go oh I found blood I found blood okay we got to follow [ __ ] [ __ ] you okay well it's downstairs I guess oh it's really close look once it's on your ass there is just no way to get rid of it I'm just screwed for Life am I though I can't find me you can't fight me you didn't see me go in here whatever whatever that was a that was a bug it could it couldn't have seen that icy Poler thanks for the raid appreciate it how you doing sir how was the stream me give you a shout out go give icy some love guys hope you had a lovely stream hope you won some games and I hope you're having a lovely Friday evening um we are playing a game that I'd rather not be playing honestly cuz it's super [ __ ] hard but hey we're here and we're doing it food was good had pizza that was nice shower was nice it was a bit wet um I expected that must say it is what I expect from a shower so that was uh that was okay uh there's BL BL here right so I need blood so you would say why don't you follow the blood then but that leads downstairs can't I just scoop it up damn it all right so we have to go down somehow oh hi I'm screwed again what if I do this now like boom will that help how's the game so far um we've done like two puzzles so far but I am quite stuck I don't really know what to do now and that is exactly what this game is it basically sens you around not knowing what the actual crap to do with a monster on your ass and nothing ever makes sense so yeah it's delightful it's it's a great game 10 out of 10 five stars like I think what I'm doing is I'm looking looking for a body so I can scoop up some blood [ __ ] why am I doing that off oh now I'm going back to the safe room going to watch some Formula 1 enjoy enjoy dude thanks for the raid I'll see you later okay I'm just going to get into the safe room I think that despawns him all right is there something I missed here maybe is there blood here I'm not hurt I know I am mentally hurt does that count God damn it guys this game is going to take me so long okay this is all closed let's make sure there's nothing I missed here cuz this is downstairs that is where the blood was leading to right it let me downstairs so you would say there might be a body somewhere here but that would only happen if this game would make some [ __ ] sense but it doesn't a man everything is locked how long to be says 12 hours okay you can make that one under 12 then because I'm playing it it's like I I want to go in here everything is locked this might be the first Rage Quit guys there's no way [ __ ] Maybe maybe maybe I don't know the hell am I supposed to do guys I don't get it [Music] I don't think I yeah I did check everything upstairs oh come on all right follow me despawn him and then we go up boom should be gone now back to the shadow realm dude after this game I can't wait for something chill and fun and engaging like some observation Duty or hopefully not FNAF I don't know maybe FNAF maybe FNAF is actually fun I I think I played it once although I wasn't really a fan back then and I um maybe you go exactly you know something fun no not you go but at least that game is only an hour I mean this game is like well it never ends cuz I don't know what to do how do I get over there come on did this is some sort of Clue like there's blood here oh this door is actually open guys I am I am all the way back here what there anything new in here I doubt it guys I'm not rage quitting it's it's not happening I'm not rage quitting any game like suck it guys that punishment wheel you guys are never going to see it so we're going to have to figure figure out something else with that it sounded like a fun idea that that would probably happen a few times but I don't know I don't know I might have to rethink the punishment wheel I don't know how realistic it is because I'm too good at video games wait till Han watch me okay I am being I'm jinxing it so hard right now are those is that Mentos three times the one chip challenge I I I ate one corner of the one chip um and I think I think that's when I died I'm not actually alive right now cuz that really that that murdered me there just one little corner I was not prepared to take a whole bite because I I was quite drunk and friends were doing the challenge and I was like I am not getting paid for this so I'm not doing that so I was like I'll take a little bit well that was enough why you die you know the one chip challenge it's like the hottest chip in the freaking world it's annoying you do it on stream I we did do well we did the spicy noodles with double the hot sauce and I did an auma pepper um on camera and I put that on YouTube I just don't have it online anymore because it's a really old video and it was it it's a bit cringe to see that back so I put that video on private but it's out there it still exists just can't see it anymore so you just have to believe me on my word and I did a ghost pepper and that I don't know if there's video evidence of that but did you see that that was his hand oh [ __ ] [ __ ] I I did that freaking ghost pepper and that's when I said I will never eat these freaking weird Peppers again because that was uh absolutely horrible that was so bad throw some chest hair I have a few I have like six chest hairs well that free Lun isn't even that hard well I I think so which is weird because I do eat a lot of spicy food so you would say I would build up some resistance right but I just don't a I locked myself in this room again guys darn it all right what the crap do I do it sucks that I you guys never played this right I have no one here that played this game unbelievable I pressed the wrong button yo what's up coola Korean it it it did the one in 81 chance how many games are on the wheel 81 there were 81 games on the wheel and it had to be paper dolls 2 the hardest one on the Wheel the hardest game on the wheel it had to be that one to start off my my PR we vacation I'm probably going to be playing paper dolls for three weeks how you doing cool like hope you're having a nice Friday because if you're having a nice Friday then strap on in and let me ruin that how many games are waited um Michigan is waited till 10: so wait of 10 so it's 10 times bigger um then we have Hano which is at 9 now I think then we have condemned is at like three or four and I think signal is is uh is two so a few of them four it was getting too Pleasant so I came here oh sh yeah you know what just killed me just kill me I I I went the wrong way anyway what I just smacked you on the ground oh God Hano all right Hano is at 9 right now can show you guys Hano and Michigan are the are the big ones all right um what what were you saying what's on the right side right okay so we can check that I'm going to assume the monster is on the stairs again no he's not you guys are definitely allowed I won't tell the police to give me hints to help me play this game because if you guys don't do that and I'm not allowed to use a guide myself then we're never finishing it we're never finishing it I will grow old gray tired you know I'll be playing this with kidney stones and old age dementia okay this is at the right side it it's nothing like absolutely nothing well that there there's a locked door what's that peanuts you kidding me okay I got it okay whose blood is this though how how do I I can I check white tiger blood bottle it's okay so all right okay that wasn't too hard I was just blind I can't believe it how do I get back this way right let me see if that's for the door let me safe let me safe let's start with that actually I can check if it's this door or not yes okay yeah so this is in Chinese [ __ ] if I [Music] know so it's a damn it it's like one of the elements lucky or fluent I would definitely yeah yeah thankfully I uh I've had Chinese food once don't know if that helps but I did all right so let's let's read up let's read up blood curse so to break the seals on the door you got to do two back flips only have one sock on put a wet finger up your right ear uh a middle finger right up your bum hole and land on your toes right one must in succession arrange the pointer of a compass in correspondence to the host's five elements so who's the host we haven't metal is this mistress Yin I don't know whose blood I have it is mistress Yin because we heard our talking at the dinner table so okay what if it's metal which one says metal guys like the whole thing is metal okay I'm going to have to need some answers of the compass at least because it's it's not translated so payday no not payday um penis no uh what's the name paper dolls to Compass translations here we go okay metal is it's the little Housey thingy okay can I put this somewhere on my other screen yes smaller all right okay okay okay God damn it now it's gone there so it is yeah it's it's the one where it's pointing towards actually okay so that's the only thing I have to look up because it's I don't speak Chinese okay hope I'm not running out of blood here it is this way boom baby b break a blood curse now this area is way too open something is going to scare me silence is going to scare me hello anything in here think I can pry it open with something hard well where's my knife I thought I had a knife I need you there no trust me I got this [Music] she get spanked okay yes can I save somewhere like I'm making too much progress here I can hide in there still incomplete why I can't open this oh okay fine Mr Z gave each one of us ass satchet said that Mr Yin had soon them herself she's really really the best we like Jin xan's Magnolia sat the most did you know why flowers are divided into five colors the soul into five elements as these colors May Mix soul can Souls five Souls one of each element can give could guide the boy Soul Back to The Living cool you say so what's that sound I don't like it anything here yes a match anything here can't open that that's locked yeah that's locked all right I guess we go back yeah I can see why this game takes 12 hours guess we'll we'll have to do a 12h hour stream guys 16 more followers on Twitch 16 then we'll do a 12 hour stream I swear to God guys it is so hard to get twitch followers these days it's [ __ ] I've gained 150 Subs on YouTube 200 followers on Tik talk twitch my main platform I lost four followers it's so stupid I swear to God twitch you suck oh there we go safe room light a stick of Alo and play it in the place it in the incense burner if the gods can sense your sincerity they will appear before you and bless you once the aloy is burnt out the blessing the Blessed ashes can can be used to cure wounds [Music] ah there were never real fans to begin with I missed them though okay it hurts thought it was something meaningful you know if you click on that follow button hold up where am I there we go all right [Music] safe and well let's go back I haven't found anything new well I [Music] found nothing yeah absolutely nothing going to be so lost in this place [Music] I've been there that's locked I go in here no that's locked here oh that's where I came from [ __ ] all right so the other way still need to find something to Pride that open with like I don't have anything I thought I had a knife I just don't know where it went accidentally no nobody does that the only people who do that that's guys that have a girlfriend and follow women on the internet and then they say oh I accidentally click the follow button like I don't know where you know they do that those are the only people that that accidentally follow someone you know um oh can I open this oh here we go all right um this one plan baby January narcissist elegant like Jade they sway lightly in the breeze akin to a Dam's wave illuminated By Moonlight oh my God February Magnolia the chill of the spring you know what I am not going to read all of this crap because it is part of a puzzle and we'll see it it when we see it okay how about that what can I do with this only I had the right item if only this game made sense she meant nothing it was just one stream exactly I was I swear I was wearing my clothes when I was watching can I do a back flip no all right so that's locked so basically that means that this is just a dead end for now that's great that is absolutely great oh my God paper dolls too more like running around with your dick in your hand still what is this Earth okay we found his uh thingy oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I forgot how to use a keyboard oh my god that hurt that was not fun I did not expect a monster right outside the door here that oh my God contains the pun punishment wheel well the punishment wheel has stuff like another 12-hour stream it has the spicy noodles it has shaving my beard off it has gifted Subs that was the original title but it was copyrighted by an obscure game company I think that's what it means if you actually translate it from Chinese all right I don't I don't know what to do like my God this game's going to get so frustrating hello is there anything I can do here quite a large area you would say there's something here but no like I have nothing to go on either right I I I need something hard oh great can't pull my pants down now I need to complete games like if I don't complete a game there there's some sort of punishment involved there's like a wheel with stuff on it that we have to spin and then it could be like eating spicy noodles or shaving off my beard but I kind of maybe want to rethink that because I'm not sure if that's it's more fun to just really stick to a game like I I'm not even allowed to [ __ ] quit I think that's more fun it's more painful than some spicy noodles you know this game is is basically a punishment on itself so I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that yet but for now it's like I have to finish the game that that's my goal here 100 games start to finish I am super warm and I might strip on stream um no I can't do that but I might have to like like change outfit um slip into something you know nicer for you guys uh yeah let me do that real quick hold up hold up it's way too [ __ ] hot there maybe I get more fewers now you know um I can't believe I'm not dead guys where the [ __ ] do I go like I can't okay let let me we have to focus here because I can't do anything here here right there's nothing that is locked and over here's the safe room I think no that's also locked this is open but there isn't anything I can do here because there is a closet that is closed oh see here we go here we go we got a map that's nice and we got some rope so now I can end it all I'm done let's look where I can hang my okay okay we're not going to do that I don't think I've seen any any place where I could use rope give me some rope I'm got me lose more followers exactly for that thing with the crank did I already forget yeah I already forgot wait hold up what's at the far end here because I walk back but that thing with the crank oh God see this is why I suck at this far back has the safe room and it also leads upstairs it's just safe because we have rope now [Music] Bing Bong okay thir War I think I can hear the monster oh here this oh my God you're you're right stas oh my God how did I forget this stas you are a legend see you are my favorite fer now um he also oh wait I I can jump on it come on no no he he's smart all right 200 IQ 205 even oh we we found something hard now we can stick in chest no no no dick no cheese no knife knife knife I keep waiting for my dad to come back and say oh yeah that's right how did I forget this yeah exactly same same he's he's out there it'll come back just keep believing it's just really busy at the gas station um you know cuz a lot of people have cards and a lot of people need cigarettes um so it's it's just probably you know there's probably just a lot of people there at the gas station he'll be back he'll be back the furba is a weapon that's capable of repelling evil spirits it is tuned to the spirit world and begin shaking when a spirit draws near viant as it draws closer all right so it starts vibrating when there's a monster nearby I guess blocking with the fur exactly as a spirit attacks creates a powerful shock wave knocking it back oh so you do have a way to defend yourself is that okay um anything else here no are we going to look at this hi what's going on is is does he have asthma oh it's a flashlight thought it wasn't oh why that was unnecessary am

drinking beer it's not the best beer but it's all I have right now oh [ __ ] did he just drop from the ceiling boom your dad's infinite stash well my my dad is dying so he doesn't drink anymore so that that stash is not there all empty I now have to get my own stash and guess who's too lazy for it think I did it your brothers yeah that's what I'm [Laughter] drinking this is my brother stash I think I have a little bit of um pee in my Underpants but besides that I think I also still have a little bit of uh heroin um penis um whiskey left I'll get it after this we time to Sol someone who died a violent death and whose corpse has in some way been mutilated will fail to let go of their anger becoming a Restless Spirit seek to dispel such a spirit you must find its missing body parts and attach them to their corpse so we need some arms uh uh no I'm out of Jack I think it's red label it's also not my stash but nobody else drinks it so might as well uh that's the only way in which you can call upon their Spirit to return to the body there are two ways to deal with the Restless Spirit first being releasing them drip upon the Implement blood of the killer before piercing a paper doll with it okay if your heart is good good and sincere the blood will act as a medium guiding the spirit to let go of the past and reach nirvana this method requires a payment of blood soul for a soul if you will though it you will suffer in the process the second being destroying them steal your heart and instill the spirit with fear whereupon you simply pierce it all with your Implement destroying it for good this method is direct but requires a result steal though you will not be harmed in the process okay is it [ __ ] [ __ ] matter can I safe dick jeez nice St nice one I [ __ ] knew it expect it how many points for whiskey shots that's illegal like this guy this game really tries to scare you but it basically sucks the life out of you and not in a good way so you don't get scared anymore

[Music] here right I think this will lead to the safe room I'm I'm starting to understand the layout of this map a bit kind of not really yeah I can save here but let's do that let's drink save then we need to find the music box let me check some NES on my [Music] phone well did I save I saved right let's just assume I saved I think it's in the masturbate room here watching your own you think

the the one with the was it was it just not the stage look it was a big room and it had a music box that's what I'm looking for right now Jesus this place is huge now the stage is just the balcony

gulps that's all I can [Music] do that's not what I expected but that works this one uh left right [ __ ] so weird man I hate this game there we go okay so no it wasn't this room I'm stupid I'm stupid what was the room where you could was it no it was behind the one of the cabinets that was it where was that cabinet [ __ ] reckon it was this room maybe it was like a hidden hidden room [ __ ] all right well now we got to find that room keep an eye out for other stuff under way there or also still don't know what do I actually do with the pearls I have I hear a weird sound can't go down here oh my God all right yeah go down there it's definitely not on this floor I think not too sure actually drawing room think that leads me all the way to the beginning yeah it does there an enemy here okay anyway go down again I can't believe I'm still playing this I every inch in my body just wants to R quit this but I don't want to spin the wheel guys I don't want to do it okay [ __ ] this is the safe room yeah and where is the room okay it might be this yes yes yes yes yes yes okay please let this be it on the other hand oh my God you guys are horrible okay I got to give blood again I guess if you have the joy to gift someone this hot mess you know how this this game was not that cheap actually it was almost 20 bucks I'm just saying hold up hold up hold up [ __ ] I think it was it 20 I think 16 something oh wow okay okay okay that's another one I completely forgot about that one I know where it is safe all right guys we're back we're back we were a bit stuck yesterday so if you're watching this on YouTube I did cut out about 40 minutes of just me walking around and shouting at the game cuz we the last 40 minutes yesterday we didn't do anything we didn't get anywhere because we're still looking where to put that torso um I still don't know about the torso I know a general area where it used to be but I think it's gone there because I'm pretty sure we were there and there was nothing but what I ignored yesterday is this key okay I'm going to have sudden pain bursts all right my shoulder is [ __ ] today um the cabinet key I ignored that there is a locked cabinet somewhere in this game no I actually know where I just don't know the name of that room CU it's the room with all the books where we had to stack all the books so it's not the thir floor is it maybe it is is it the drawing room I don't know mon sper no I kind of remember the layout of the room I guess we're just going to have to look around and see if I can find it maybe I should like copy paste the maps and [Music] paint when did this open by the way what are you watching uh sopia can down still not strong as an NCO if you like set an alarm every 10 minutes and be the first one to snipe that that weight adding it's not here yisen I don't remember the last time I've seen an anime okay so the perfume room is also a [Music] um safe [Music] room why did that scare me oh you don't have much points to redeem yeah I made it quite expensive didn't I I'm just trying to drain everyone's points because I know a lot of people have a lot of points guys where is that room where I had to stack the books where am I where floor think this is close to this also we're going to play this for two hours today and um well 2 and a half and at 10 p.m we're going to play some demonologist with Sophia and with Jimmy to check out the new map also the death from demonologist have confirmed they are not abandoning the game which is good because they pulled it out of early access without any warning like normally something like that is hyped up like oh we got a big patch coming it's coming out of Early Access you know it's it's big release um they didn't do that they just pulled it out of Early Access and they explained why it's basically just because steam advised to do that [ __ ] so they just listened to steam and they went to version 1.0 I don't even enough ammo now but you see it happen a lot that um okay is be oh my God it's going to take a while that games go out of Early Access out of nowhere and those games just get abandoned so it was kind of scary oh [ __ ] cuz I thought they would do that to demonologist too but they don't okay I think there's a safe room here hi little L how you doing welcome back hope you're having a lovely weekend okay move all right all the way back here so it wasn't upstairs I guess and where is it this the mon [Music] sper I have not played this no this is um this is new to me we played the first one paper dolls one this is the second one oh we're here okay so I think they're yeah here it is okay this should be it oh [Music] God empty oh oh oh oh that's good that's actually good can I get out oh leave there we go that is actually good um we can combine that um now there's an there's another door we can open what's over there though what does it say that this is like an opening this should be a door but it isn't oh it is oh I see okay oh for [ __ ] sake okay but let's try to remember to check that out later kind of want to see what's going on over there oh my shoulder oh god oh okay this is the door he gone no [ __ ] okay so I need to get rid of him then we have to remember that it's the mon storage basically let's despawn him by just going to the the safe room whoa see that started skating towards me that's safe oh my shoulder hurts oh I'm getting old guys it's it's so bad who's texting me I'm playing game nobody's texting me I don't have friends okay um Master [Music] Storage okay then we have to do we really have to Google the compass again it's so weird like the compass is Chinese it's not translated he's into that room I think I might get attacked here yep oh come on I don't have ammo to shoot him either ah so annoying so annoying maybe just unlucky that he spawned on this side uh-oh that heals me if you go into the the prayer room he despawns that's good wasted ammo oh we wasted a lot of ammo but I don't think you ever really need it I guess it's fine let's see what we got over here all right so I had a page for this open somewhere where is it okay so this is red which is sell and that's fire fire is this one and then Thunder I think it was this okay it's not you can check okay you can see it from the stripes I guess two open ones see I'm right one straight to open so that would be I don't know it's oh this one and then fire is this wait what the wrong one this is fire right this is fire think yes okay there we go oh I see oh this is going to be a puzzle okay well we're going to need more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 which makes sense there's I can heal here and there's bullets there's more and another heal this is going to be a boss fight feel as though if I step on this plate something's going to happen oh my God yeah attach upon Vitality Talisman seven pearls representing the Seven stars of The Big Dipper uh these must be arranged in accordance with their respective position position with the within the constellation then only and only then will one be able to extend someone's life by placing their four pillars of Destiny at the location of Polaris okay you can kind of tell how you need to arrange them anyway I don't have seven of them what waste token okay that's going to be another non-rated puzzle isn't it another heal I think this is just the area for maybe the last boss what a lot of ammo though oh my God seven bullets okay I think I got everything here now we just have to find where to place the Torso I wanted to check over here I don't think I've been there that's where the enemy came out so let's save in the prayer room and let's check it out there nothing in there right no don't really know what to do with this torso should be part of the body smart let's try something oh okay oh I'm getting good at this I'm dead oh feel the wind of his blade on my [ __ ] okay yeah he's going to constantly chase me now yo what's up Tyrell where's Barry I just did sort off you don't really attack like Counterattack which is a shame but you can get away so that's good came out of here still incomplete oh oh oh what the [ __ ] is that okay just kill me okay I need to check that room that looks like something I want to check you can run no I can't I can run for a second and then he's tired am I going the right way still no I went past it see it's really easy to miss is he going to be here again oh what the [ __ ] oh my God here she is oh [ __ ] dude all the monsters are here okay he's gone so she did move that's why we couldn't find her she moved oh [ __ ] what happened oh God this can't be good this going be good this going not be good oh take that no kidding me assault gun I think so does this ever end oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] you yes okay I think we did it

am too spaced out for it okay I can turn this this way and then Zer up I can pick it up now vibrant are the flowers fragrant is the Driftwood forming two whole legs enabling walking instead okay full story oh [ __ ] can I move this no I can move this oh wait there it's this way so that would be that the the the this one I think [Music] no [ __ ] I don't know actually oh this one okay now we can teleport in there uh that way maybe oh wait that way this one a really small one this one nothing I can do here Echoes of the living I never heard of it I'll check it out I mean we always play horror games right so with with the with the tiny exceptions sometimes a Souls game you know we played armored Core never finished it but it's not like I'm going to stop playing horror games after the 100 so uh they're always [Music] welcome oh wait I see okay okay okay this way small tiny still not enough that's the big one I think um I need this one thanks for all appreciate it um this game is hard what the freak am I doing if I just tear it off here I mean think that's going to be the goal oh wait there is so much more okay so they round one this one pick up the note I think no I can't I'm so weirded out it's definitely not here aha he he he won okay that really got me nowhere so thanks that's just great each flower blooms in a specific season similarly Souls can be can only change vessel when the time is rip the boy soul is that of water hence it requires a water body a metal metal what for [ __ ] sake guys [Music] okay that to the other side Circle no that's not the one God damn it can't do anything here teleport through these and I can move this one which it's just a big circle but how do I get in there it's not active yet so that is the one that leads me here again yeah this [ __ ] is tough um God you know it's a good thing I'm I'm that good at puzzling can't do [ __ ] with that that's the square one that's this one and the small one that way no can't jump there can't jump I I just can't jump from this one so let me let me see I need to tear that part open so I need to move that through that one maybe straight long one I think it's this one I can't go in there I guess still I'm kind of struggling here I want to turn this one around but I [Music] can't I think uh I might just be um stupid can't turn any of them possible maybe maybe maybe [ __ ] nothing in that one okay okay not that one not that one not that one where was it this one this is the only right way basically [ __ ] yeah and then this one I don't know I don't know how to get in this this is the next step basically that's the square one is the next step so that is none of these check the other side there a small one isn't that this one no okay I am um really close [Music] to destroying stuff because this is [ __ ] look why can't I just tear this off why does it have to be that side it doesn't make sense let me look at this so there's a few ones I just never touched [Music] yet um crap you reckon it's time for a guide cuz I'm stuck this one [Music] um that's the one I can move so I need to turn it around no where's the circle okay turn the circle around this way okay how do I get to that mirror into a circle that's going to be a dead question [ __ ] I'm starting to think there might not be a way can't you turn the square one from the mirror on the wall what you mean what do y mean I tried this right I tried this that wasn't it [ __ ] where is [Music] it [ __ ] why is this so stupid [Music] close no that's just no that's just that one it doesn't make sense to go in there okay so these two probably not no doubt it [ __ ] this game I swear to God what the [ __ ] am I doing she knows well that's it that's it okay I can turn this one [Music] now um okay okay I did something not to find that one one I just turned all right this is what I just did just turn this that side just [ __ ] okay so this is not going to make sense right no I need to go over there CU from there I oh wait no you know if I could only jump in there I could tear off that side what the [ __ ] okay so I I guess it has to go that way and then we have don't move that one I need to move that one I am very slow at this I can't remember I I can't [ __ ] hell dude I can't get back to this to the round one now and I don't know why it's I think it's because of this one wow my brain is hurting look I need to go to the round one somehow what the [ __ ] dude okay I'm Googling this this this really really really sucks um paper dolls to mirror wow I I'm actually [ __ ] is this it chapter two no so the thing is nobody really makes a guide of this game there's just people who played it so I'll watch Gap smolders do this oh my God okay no I need someone who speedruns this or [Music] something you can always Rage Quit yeah that's the thing I can't right I got to finish this um walk through really quite a stupid puzzle I can't find it oh I found it this is not a walkthr this is just someone also just trial and erroring I think oh [Music] God okay whatever there is no [ __ ] there is no walk through I'll give up I'll just try okay I'm suddenly back here do I turn this around is is that what I have to do okay I think I've completely [ __ ] it up now [Music] where the hell is that looking at I'm completely stuck now I can't get through any oh here what the [ __ ] okay okay okay okay hold up something here is different because there was something in between that right huh so something here I changed something Ste rooms okay my neck hurts where's the wrong one [ __ ] what this one it doesn't make sense to me guys I can't figure it out oh God I cannot wait to beat this game this is the shittiest game we've had so far and we played Harvester we played okay I'm just going to trial and error because obviously my mind is not going to make it make sense so [ __ ] do [ __ ] that usually helps turn everything that way and now I'm in the now I'm in the round mirror how did I get there it can't close but it's not it yeah this one hold up I I know where to go I just don't know how to get there look I need to get to that one yeah pull this paper on the other side get in that one I just don't know how to get in that one okay it's so weird now completely lost where I can turn the the round one that one which is the re this one no very strange so that means that I have to put this the other side somehow that should yeah okay that gets me here this side I guess I'd be done with this game by now if there were no walk through yeah the amount of times I was ready to just quit this game but that's the thing with this challenge we ain't quitters okay what the [ __ ] do I do guys [Music] this is the round one I have to do something with the round one that the other side and then I guess through this again no huh what the [ __ ] yeah this yes okay we're back here this just this is just weird Okay this squiggly one look now I see that I just don't know how the [ __ ] I'm ever going to get in there maybe through that one all the way in the back handle himself or is this [ __ ] again on I I can't handle myself I cannot that one yeah I can but then you can only tear off one side and we T off one side now we have to tear off the other side I mean we did I don't know how but we did turn that at some points wasn't here I could only tear off one [Music] side I don't know how uh how I ever got there but see wait yes here so you can turn that to this side but okay and then we go in there see I can't tear it off could only tear off one side so yeah this game sucks I am so lost feel like I'm completely missing something but the one across yeah we just turned that but we can't get in there we we can't teleport to that mirror so let me see how the [ __ ] I did that though here look we want to get in this mirror right we want to teleport to it how nobody knows cuz if I go back to this one that would be the logical one like okay teleport in there from here but I can't and I can't teleport in there from there so then what do I do that there's not much left means I can't get in that mirror so I'm just going to watch a YouTube guide for a bit see if it makes sense yes all the notes another note got that one yeah that one goes to the yes got that how long is he going to take somehow is really fast where does this lead I don't get it you and me both out my [ __ ] I am so confused too hold up what did I I just no I'll come on I I did it already guys I hated this puzzle but we did it I didn't even need the guy yeah okay the guy just showed me that's the last part but I was like what what the [ __ ] so I I already did it Jesus Christ oh now we're actually in the mirror room can I smash these mirrors so this was the rectangle oh I [ __ ] all right that's why I couldn't teleport to it because you have to go through the mirror in the mirror room to get through the it's that easy oh my God all right [Music] okay [ __ ] this [ __ ] BR so many bullets though okay where the hell am I let's start with that I'm in a mirror room okay that makes sense there are a lot of mirrors so okay I guess we go back and try to donate blood again nothing else here I might want a save Master's bedroom have I been there this is all new if you die now yes yes exactly I don't have anything what's in the box oh God four characters oh my god do I have anything okay it's this isn't it here let's try hold up I'm making a screenshot um a good screenshot Hold Up Wait that's yeah and we're just going to try these it must be this right [Music] so no it's not this at least I don't think so oh well it still could be hold up so every row needs one of these but it's Chinese so it's top to bottom right so is this one in that row no this one is on that thing this one is on there no it's not yeah that's what I'm thinking like the dash is this one under there this is so hard if you're not Chinese like [ __ ] dude um I'm I'm looking at a screenshot from the the plaque the three it's it's not on here this maybe because to me it all looks the same man it's what the freak there little boats thingy this one is definitely on there is it no it's not never mind yo what's up ARA how you doing sir do you speak Chinese um or can you go learn it real [Music] quick I don't know what the [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm [Music] doing can do neither of them right away shame no these just this one I can just find this one so what if it's not that it could be any of these try this okay this one's on there that one is on there that one is on there okay that was uh see did this is why this game is just not fun if you're English it does not make sense man oh the blue bottle all right so now we can [Music] open open boxs um this one Compass is still incomplete how wait no okay counts not yet this is all [Music] new [Music] hello a match beautiful beautiful beautiful anything else I can hide in there [ __ ] I don't want to die I don't want to die who's this I can't die now guys like no is this a new enemy I don't know gone no now now it's gone I don't recognize these footsteps though anything else yes I could have just shot it I guess whatever it is works right where the hell am I okay so that's okay let's save first then I want to go back um we still have the satchel and there must be more blue rooms somewhere I know of one going to have to find it again now out my shoulder all right um let's do this first is it beer o clock already maybe um well yes it is I might get some beers during some demonologist because how else am I going to deal with sfia true yeah I know right I already used the these two so no I used this one too yay progress what the [ __ ] is that legs a thigh o who lost a thigh that's still closed we need to find a blue room there is one [Music] somewhere save again Bing coding overloaded hold up I got to fix my [ __ ] real quick because we don't want laggy streams guys [ __ ] [ __ ] now I closed the God damn it there we go why is it overloading oh it's because my own stream is [Music] running [Music] that's what you get when you try to where you always want to lurk to your your fellow streamers when you're streaming yourself it's all pressing on the CPU okay [ __ ] when I check the M paror like one more time CU I feel like I missed something there then we have to look for a Blue Room did someone secretly subscribe because I'm pretty sure we were at 25 and now I'm at 26 someone just secretly try to subscribe if so thank you aha that's the door we just tried to open uh I need a bunny shaped thing okay we're not done here yet try to remember that for whenever we find a bunny um [ __ ] let's go through the stage I think it's the other floor hold up map not yet not yet some some here somewhere here is a dead end why is the m oh the map doesn't really change I just have to do this so that is I have no idea I have absolutely no idea where that was let's hope for the best all right let's just walk around hope for the best I can't go in there I think no oh might have not been this floor oh it is isn't it no definitely not here these no room surface that just leads me back we could go around so we can't go here because the is being blocked only way okay I think the wall was broken here yeah but it's not here it's not here oh I'm being followed there is here oh oh oh you're new what the [ __ ] see new enemy oh that is so unfortunate holy she sucks she sucks not in a good way [ __ ] okay it's on this floor somewhere it's not in the mistress Chambers it's it's not on the left side so let's try the right side yeah maybe I can interest her in a thigh still have it right yeah only progress we lost is placing the little slab on the wall but we we can't finish that anyway not here Master's bedroom that's closed Master's bedroom is closed let's try to remember that oh [ __ ] sake wow did that just completely Miss that's great that's absolutely great here we couldn't go here yet Compass is incomplete that's close well it wasn't here oh hi um hi excuse me this is a bit awkward I'm stuck because of you okay I'm loose the [ __ ] that was not supposed to happen I'm pretty sure that was uh not supposed to happen okay she teleports you Jesus Christ how the [ __ ] am I going to find it so we've been here been here this is close this leads to the book [Music] room wow how can it be so hard to find it's not here it is on the on the third floor then it almost has to be yeah she just teleports right at you makes her really [Music] tough so I have a really hard time it was a bit easier with the first game but I have a really hard time memorizing the map of this place a really really hard time it's closed we can go there can we go here no no it just Loops it back back around I am going to cheat where's the video I had I think I closed it I can find it again I'm cheating paper dolls too where's the wolf guy here okay I can show you guys oh this the guy was looking for the [Music] mirrors I'm hiding from the chick okay in there we've been [Music] there I think I know I have never been oh I have yeah yeah okay so yeah we've done this got the Torso right yes what's next see this this is the room this is what I'm looking for okay Armory Armory is it here or is it it's one of these I think it's here up what what are you what is chat saying free weights to other games on the wheel hey that is not a bad idea see this these are the ideas I like that every time I cheat I have to add one weight to the highest weigh in game or something like so that would be hanako right now yeah just kill me by the way that's fine way too condemned we could make that a thing we can make that a thing but kempt is not the highest weigh in game so or at way to a random game I'll think about this I'll think about this I I like the idea though here wait is it the a squarters it isn't it can't be the practice room oh my God [Music] okay blue please yes all right see so I was right with where I have to go I just couldn't [ __ ] find it I think she's trying to attack me but I'm busy all right it's pointing to the east blue East is water water would be this one and I didn't

okay let's wait did I save yeah I did let's try that I think we're close no we got to go to the other side right yeah let's see if we can use that the same as one of the pouches I think that might be it was it this room no guys if I can finish this game I can finish every game on the wheel okay the only thing that that I really don't want to play that's on there still is amnesia debunker and I'm not sure how ready I am for Dino Crisis because PlayStation 1 games are always kind of a [ __ ] you know oh for [ __ ] sake whoa okay all right that hurts oh [ __ ] I didn't save I thought I did save God damn it all right we can do that really quick really quick speedrun come [Music] on okay I'm going to try to just there's nothing else here right except for this and there's one more paper I think where am I through here I'll save a this site it's a bit faster well all right I don't need to heal right [Music] now look the the whole thing this game is definitely unique in its own way right they have a thing going but they didn't have to make this thing so [ __ ] tedious you know cuz it definitely has its good sides it's just oh my God the puzzles are tough enough already and while trying to figure out puzzles you got these [ __ ] chasing your ass all the [ __ ] time it's unbelievable is he going to spawn here every time or I was just unlucky I guess so can I use that here oh my God I [Music] can all right we have someone's ass oh we got the hearts okay but who needs the hearts for oh [ __ ] [Music] you yes we got to find the baby because the baby died and maybe we can give it a heart I don't know um so we have balls we have hearts can't combine it the [ __ ] am I supposed to do guys run around in 500 circles again okay that is so strange but let's use the balls through the stage like that was at Master Storage right the balls room check it out I think that's what I have to do let me bring back chat is my stream still live it is and why is my chat gone okay weird weird weird weird weird fixed that is not a door this is a door wrong way I'm so ready for the next game like please just let this be the end I don't think it's going to be the end yet there's no there aren't any locked doors any yeah there is one more lock door oh I [Music] shouldn't all right boss fight oh what the [ __ ] this is why there were so many bullets are you stuck ow you're a [ __ ] there no no no no no no no no okay we got to right again let's save close by here this is uh this is not working oh oh wow we have an auto save that is so kind of this game yeah sit down there we go speedrun sit uh W what no no okay we're fine yeah it's the first auto save that I'm like okay that is actually useful oh my God what if I run out of ammo now guess that [Music] works oh God a phase two what is this Dark [Music] Souls oh wow okay heal the good news is there there are heels in almost every corner [ __ ] could that be it oh [ __ ] I all tapped by accident okay here we let me check Tik Tok hold up the name of the game is paper dolls 2 and although it does look look sick it's also really [ __ ] hard thanks Neil appreciate [Music] it okay is that the last one got an achievement witness monster Yin sedok okay one two three four now let's see in what order I have to uh okay so the okay so we start with red red red orange yellow let me grab all of them there we go it is on Steam yeah there's paper dolls original and there's paper dolls 2 this is uh paper dolls 2 oh [ __ ] I need the paper okay yes so the reason this game is hard is because most puzzles are in Japanese and it some of them don't really translate well to English and that makes it a [ __ ] wait where am I blue dark blue and purple okay this must be it uhoh what going to happen I don't know what just happened oh no did this open maybe I kind of really want to Safe can't Crouch maybe I just have to go back maybe what happens if I go through this door all right let me just save no what the hell do I do thanks for the gift dude appreciate it I don't really hear or see my uh my alerts on Tik Tok if you want to get over to the other side we are live on Twitch right now incate on Twitch that's where everyone is that's where we're playing where the [ __ ] do I go I didn't get any new items right no I think I still need something for my compass you will grab the damn bullets on stairs wait there's bullets on the stairs oh my God there is I didn't even see that I did not see that then what else is there there must be there must be more okay let me just go to the safe room what could this have done maybe it's in a note [Music] somewhere so no man um think this is the safe room yes what do I do now must be close to ending this right all right let's uh probably there just there must be something there at least I saved makes me feel better makes me not feel so rushed I do forget that this this um game actually has Autos saving because the first one didn't that was even worse also welcome back Dennis how how was the Dark Walk anything here no oh here we go Mr study there we go that's the last lock door I think we have a moners fan don't know what to do with that the last puzzle piece is in the mistress bedroom same as every other day did he poop like did he did he poop nicely okay okay okay I think we're she right yeah good good good proud what the [ __ ] oh hi you did to

wing hungry I'm not going to lie chickin yeah chickin Wings I'm not going to lie you are actually correct I I'm a bit hungry but I already had McDonald's today so I'm not going to order more you know these cups are really nice though you can pay1 extra and then you get the the deposit cups and you can return this for €1 but it's it's very tough plastic so you can just reuse this play beer pong

during the day I've basically been watching other streamers and I've been like this that was the only position I was comfortable in and then I started my stream and I was like oh [ __ ] I got to sit straight now and that took a while because that was okay now now it hurts again but that was a [ __ ] now it's fine ish how do I get there though oh [ __ ] Mr study oh oh okay that's uh that's

to be Allen wake remastered so hey who knows who knows this probably Hano right it's probably Hano oh there he goes okay I got you hold up uh picker wheel Hano is at 14 now look at it go wait can I also add that to Tik [Music] Tok um just for if we're display one is is this display one no that's that's not the right display display [Music] to there we go so Tik Tok knows what we're talking about

I'm going to need a key hello gosh darn it let's look around [Applause] man I want to live here well I say that now but that's the thing I probably don't want [Applause] that that's open oh hello we got to notes excavation quote after examination of your dirt Cellar an excavation of the area would be a challenging job but it would also be reflected in the pricing seeing as most of the area around your property is an old swamp area the risk of water flooding during the work will require many pumps depending on when the work will be done during the year here we will have to make proper precautions regarding the humidity within the tunnels for a worker safety estimated price for the work that's a lot of money um it's a lot of money um a more exact number can be esta when we meet in person to talk about specific of project thanks for thinking about choosing bir Birch excavations or as a potential partner dear Birch excavations [ __ ] you and your life fil quote for that kind of job this land is mainly granite and farious rocks I've done some digging myself and as sure as hell didn't see any water I'm going to kindly decline your [ __ ] offer do this job myself for one ten of the price that's reasonable yeah Sophia has played everything thing is that oh I need a tool I added a note in my journal oo o need a crowbar there are planks that are blocking door in the smaller house oh that's nice so you don't have to like remember everything he likes he like makes notes of it I like that can't really open anything right that's true but when I see Sophia play shitty games I just add them to my list so I was watching sea play a bit of a paranormal VHS and the first time I asked him like Hey how do you how are you liking the game he was like oh I I really like it it's it's really nice I think it's very short then the next day I came back and I was like do you still like it and he was like this game is never ending and he was legit pissed off he was just so sad so I can't wait for that one apparently the game just didn't want to end welcome I apologize so much for this inconvenient way of entering the house but don't worry it's all part of the evening's plans it is basically to set the scene for what is to come the display of the main art attraction is located in the sun room just to the left as you leave this room we'll get started as you get there again welcome it is an honor to have you here please enjoy your stay okay have you guys seen the incred CATE merchandise no it doesn't really exist anymore this this is a gem from back in the days guys it's a shirt with my face on it you can't get this anymore this was back in 2018 I I found it today and I was like holy [ __ ] I completely forgot about that yeah I think I took a down once because nobody's going to buy I think about two people actually bought this shirt but who else is going to buy a [ __ ] shirt with my face on it I get it I wouldn't too but I did cuz it's my own face found a key outside listen you're allowed to leave the house in fact you're encouraged to be a good artist and explore this wonderful property however leaving the property will turn into your execution and we don't want that okay found a key did you did you have one nice I mean I I did give a few away too oh I thought I had a key only Legends have it Yep this is the rule wall don't go into the basement have fun and draw don't talk about your parents no food in bed wash your hands after using the buck it no knocking mom and dad are bad people what they hated you I don't don't use the phone again be quiet no screaming art is the only way forward we will teach the world together this world is sick you are sick don't touch your clock sorry we are nothing but filth speak only when asked okay so what kidna kids or something can't go to the basement this that's the art room this is it well it's not complete and that is the main reason why I invited you here I want you to complete it finish it together with me I've waited so long for this to happen and it's so close now oh so very close it's simple five Empty Easel waiting to be used I simply want you to find the right astonishing beautiful art pieces and put them back in the right order okay the sad part is that you can't leave the property I've got eyes and ears in the woods so don't try anything cowardly such as running away from this creation for it will be the end we got to try it right I promise you this will be fun so please be part of the creation I'm going to try to run away it must be like a must be like an achievement want to check hold hold up let me check now I'm curious uh let me see if that that shirt is still oh my God I think it is guys let me look for my name on here oh my God you can still get [Laughter] it this is the shirt I thought it was more though oh yeah the long sleeve t-shirt tank tops sweatshirts oh here you go guys here you go if if you want increate apparel go for it go for it I don't think I get anything from that but be part of the creation uh is it oh [ __ ] thanks Jimmy thanks Jimmy I need the paintings to be put back in order this is the big art piece or collection the centerpiece of my creations and the reason why people should care monsters are among us and no imaginary ones either no people like me my father my mother are all around the world spreading like pasts and care nothing but feeling a void inside themselves we are real and no creature fancy or imagination that can top nightmares that we leave behind this is my way of making sure people will open their eyes people like me should not be able to roam free if the safety nets actually worked none of this would have been a thing people would not have gone missing people would not have suffered people would not have perished for no other reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time now I ask you to put together this collection in order and be aware of the red herring oh okay I'm going to try to run away I want to see what happens if you like try to run away from this place I don't think you can honestly no it's just it's all wed off I don't think you can really leave [Applause] this sad Okay so check the house okay so we need to find five paintings found one oh okay this was locked that's locked the playroom while photography isn't really an art form that I enjoy there is still a fascinating aial photography history that I do give them credit for postmortem photography the idea that you want to keep a memory of a loved one after its passing and make sure that the empty corpse looks as close to Alive as possible is quite frankly compelling to say the least yeah sure okay um I see num [Music] so 4 6 three two oh God there's a lot of numbers oh God okay I got this no worries oh okay I see be part of the vision because the Victorian era cameras took so long to develop each photo the actors in the frame would have to stay still for a long duration of time because of this it was usually very easy to spot the deceased person in a family photo it would have been perfect sharpness while the rest would be slightly blurry stand still in the right spot and your focus will become clear you might want to come back here a little later see the right angle through another lens shine some light on the problem at hand ah okay I cannot not do this just yet hang the dead mysterial use strange tape old photos of the Dead uh okay don't think I could do this yet sh shine a light I think I need something like camera or black light oh my God these are creepy big yikes this game is absolutely gorgeous by the way go upstairs mannequin hler storage isn't is that a game that's coming out soon pretty sure I've seen that on Twitter dark web streamer oh God what is this oh see all right I'm going to need uh an example of that home sweet home doll house and fer electrical wires LED lamps and [Applause] magnets The Carter family was just like any other family a loving mother supporting father and a cheerful child however there are only the observations from those on the outside looking at the facade of the crumbling House of a family okay so we need to read that somehow and then we can like reconstruct this but we we can't read that Calvin was a good kid great even the first time I saw those eyes I noticed he was meant to be something more more than just a fessel for my message but a profit sapling ready to grow his new family tree to spread its roots in God forsaken world and rid of all the unfairness the system has caused us when I noticed my fishing was but a mirage all I could see was red feel red smell red create red I'm me sure it was quick it was awfully sticky afterwards what this another one I can't do yet then we have a we have a knife said something about the knife after the deed was done the knife was dropped in front of the father's favorite reading spot pointing towards the murderer as is that going to be enough pointing towards the murderer as the child BL out on the floor now we need more in front of the father favorite re in spot so was here oh there I guess it rested on the floor pointing towards the [Applause] murderer who's the murderer CH blood out on the floor well there's another one yeah okay we we can't do this yet it doesn't make sense yet spooky poem of two armies two armies lined up ready to fire their arrows one site painted their feathers in ashite the others in blood in honor they took turns to fire at each other to show who had the best archers as the fight went back and forwards the sons fell first the fathers there after and the last one standing was the old King final goodby mumbled as his legs gave away a chest filled with a chest filled with covered arrows okay okay can't go there either can't do anything here oh Jesus okay can't go there huh maybe outside then it's said like you might want to come back here a little later see the right angle through another lens yeah okay definitely not doing this

needed a light source why don't you grab this I did wander into another priest's home I'm afraid yeah if you saw what was written on the wall it it does sound like a priest home I can't go back [Applause] there this look one grave oh we do have another puzzle game on our hands you can tell by the way I'm already lost as usual I must be able to do one of the puzzles I [Applause] guess hm definitely not that it's all empty born in desperation to escape the torture this man help me under for so many years there was no there was but one chance to break out of the circle of pain at Night My careful steps made me feel like I was flying flying towards the bedroom where the Beast s uh slept not a single sound could be heard as I plunged a knife into his throat messy unprofessional and chaotic but a first St nonetheless I was finally free from the agony bedroom oh wait so okay the snow gently from the sky slowly covering the ground in white out in the middle of nowhere I had an errand to run I was late the delivery was my final chance to redeem myself from previous mistakes vehicle went around a corner and my feelings went from stress to emptiness as the car made two loud bumping noises I realized it was already too late two people laid in front of me screaming crawling towards me with their legs broken they were unlucky all emotions were drained from my soul left an empty husk inside I walked back to my car and ran him over again and again until I heard no more crying until no more crying could be heard only then did I feel something he was the one deep breaths slow breaths painful breaths the shakes are violent like Tremors in an earthquake as they seiz our eyes meet for the first time I question my actions he was the only one who would understood me the one person of this world who could talk to without feeling like a monster his body goes limp my hands hurt from The Firm grasp of on his Thro the uh the eyes those of those once beautiful eyes suddenly turned something grotesque saw my reflection in them ugly green and stared back this is just what those paintings are supposed to be I guess screams always with the screams why can't they face the fact that it's about to end the man is pleading for his life from his new metal home looking down in him that feeling comes rushing again I am in control his Screams Come muffled as I slam the heavy metal hat shut through despair escapes his throat as Darkness wases over him but not for long I turn the F and Flame rushes in a beautiful display of dance and song in the most gruesome [Applause] form uh the lake was more peaceful than I could ever imagine his Beauty struck something inside me the urge to capture this moment somehow those days past pain torture washed over me as I realized the best course of action all right I could not uh I would have to go back and see if I could manage to create again I take a final look into the lake and make sure that the bows have finally stopped I was finally happy uh okay that's not helping well it said something about the bedroom let's go find the art pieces I guess every puzzle has an art piece huh am I really supposed to be able to do this this one like it's all [ __ ] up it's like any other family a loving mother supporting father and a cheerful child mother father and a child from the I outside looking at the of crumbling house after the de was done the knif was dropped in front of Father favorite reading spot rested on the floor po take towards the murderer as a child BL down on the floor and then we have red fuel red smell red create red first time I saw this eyes and nose he was meant to do something more more than just a fessel for my message but a prophet a sapling ready to grow a new family free guess that's the dad oh no she he dead I don't know man doesn't make sense [Applause] yeah office is locked this is probably part of a puzzle sometime because you can add up [Music] numbers I can't go here because I don't have a light source huh like I haven't done anything in this game yet I'm already stuck am I that stupid guys all right let's go outside again I guess maybe I'm still did miss something I haven't found anything I can pick up [Applause] yet so dark that was locked right yeah it's a shed it's locked I mean that that's probably where where you'll find a crowbar anything in here oh come on [Applause] game what was this again oh it was about the dirt seller right yeah he was dgg that himself for 10% of Sur prise and we've been to the dirt seller but we need a battery and there well I

moon oh there oh it's an Unreal Engine [Applause] Moon [Applause] that is the way back that I can't go right I can't go there no I feel stupid this game just makes you feel stupid already I just walked in a [Applause] circle double check cheese not stupid just not smart enough I like that I like [Applause] that I'll take that next game just kidding um I got this don't [Applause] worry I am stupid though sometimes games can have the most perfect easy Clues lay out in front of me and I'm still like what what are you on about that's why we play puzzle games no notes or anything right no okay I've used that already um we a good arst exploit a wonderful property okay all I could see was red this is part of another puzzle I think arrows wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait see I said about the dartboard right that that probably yeah this just a dark board to our is lined up ready to fire their arrows one side painted def with Ash right the blue arrows the Blue Darts and the blood the red darts they took turns to fire at each other show who had the best archers yeah it's it's about darts uh F went back and forwards Sons fell first the fathers therea okay M just lag gave I don't know because that door is still locked I don't think that's part of a puzzle I have to do right now I remember that okay I [Applause] [ __ ] what do I do go back in the [Applause] house let's finger it out a lot of ice nothing I can pick up here got this puzzle but got to see this from a different lights or a different lens probably need something like a camera or Str tape you also play this nice this is part of oh my God red well this is [Applause] red nil it definitely didn't need help I I believe you oh wait there is oh oh never mind there is literally a [ __ ] okay all right okay so we need four okay this is easy um nine so 27 it's not going to be this easy right no always start with the easiest stuff that's not it that ain't it hold oh my God notes two armors lined up right to fire arrows one site painted FS others in blood that's the colors of the arrows right took turns this defy went back and forth the sons fell first the Father therea the last one standing was their King final goodbye M as his legs gave away it just feel what the hell any hints here huh the Suns fell first what what does that even mean oh wait it means what it means thanks thanks guys are helpful appreciate that [Music] 27 single digits maybe it doesn't it does not make single sense to me wait a minute no it doesn't really make sense so maybe use the numbers on the photos but no no no no know one also doesn't make sense [Applause] yet sorry guys this is a bit boring because I don't know what to do Sol single dig digits something to do with the pool table maybe hi fuu struggling is never boring well this this is starting to turn into suffering going I play Freebird no this is n n not this yet I I think the the the dartboard one is the one I have to do first I just don't know how I'm I'm trying to think what it means to be the the Father the sons and the old King I don't know where to find anything about that Jesus Christ you look at that okay um did did this is all I have um okay all I know is that my brain [Applause] hurts one side painted their feathers in azerite the others in blood okay that makes sense the darts they're blue blue and red in honor they took turns to fire at each other show had the best Archer that makes sense that's a game of darts as the fight went back and forwards the Suns fell first Fathers thereafter and the last one was the old King chest filed with blood C wow my hat legit hurts no I can I can keep on going outside but there's nothing there I am so confused sons and fathers mom and dad are bad people

don't know what I did what the [ __ ] no no I was just like okay let's let's do the single ones like two uh um seven nine eight and play around with those numbers right so instead of 2798 I wanted to do 89 and play around with it but now I got it and I still don't know how I [ __ ] got oh my God that's not fun that's not fun now I've done the puzzle without knowing how to do the puzzle I'm not allowed in that room yet till I know how the [ __ ] I did that so it was 2718 18 so 27 and 18 is it because red one come on a chest filled with blood covered arrows okay so red one and because red one you just use Red's numbers is that it that that's the puzzle you guys confirm or not confirm if I'm right here but that that would be is it that easy just red one use R's numbers h confused well I did it somehow brute forced it kind of not really I did use numbers of the board I hear someone previous residence affecting the previous residence of this house was a tricky nut to crack I had to make sure that they all passed in a beautiful way there je what uh okay [Music] [Laughter] dick it's completely broken nice try though after days of planning I only had a fake plan on what I had to do it was important to me that they would never leave the property after all head theirs and should be part of it the question is not when or by what means it's about where I am still so confused I want to know if I'm right about that puzzle whatever I did it it's fine we got a [ __ ] with an L I got a front door key front door key isn't really going to help me with anything is it wait maybe it is well I'd rather have sliding puzzles because you can just it's just basically trial and error oh oh oh oh oh wow mannequins the father of the house was undoubtedly the hardest and easiest Target for me hardest because I didn't know how I would react act andest because of how I reacted seeing him sleeping on the bed took me back to my childhood and one simple blow to his head was all I needed to leave him unconscious he woke up still in his bedroom to the gracious Touch of Flames that burned beneath him his beautiful screams were something I wish my own dad would have left me but alas damn okay mother Charlotte calin's mother Charlotte fought more than any of my victims ever did she got really good hits on me while I regret a while that I didn't render her unconscious prior I got the sweet Screams I crave so badly at times this time however they were muffled as I forced her head down into the bathtub I promised her that I would take care of Calin I kept the promise for as long as I could basement key all right progress guys another clock we only one one hand okay I guess we go down to the basement wait what's that aligned triangle plaque okay that's something it did say not to

Rover is like the easiest to steal hello I'm the result of a problem I don't have the solution but I might point someone in the right direction the art of sculpturing this was absolutely the hardest kind of art form to get right I tried various mat cloth concrete but nothing really fit what I was going for oh [ __ ] then it dawned on me the purest form the human body this took a bit of time to get right countless of kind unwilling donators had to be used before I got the formula down rigor mortis sure was a tricky nut to crack sometimes literally but after dozens of hours reading into biology and chemistry here we are and it is almost perfect please just finish it for me and we have House of a Thousand Corpses yeah House of Wax next thing we're going to do is murder Paris Hilton um

their fears see I already got that without okay that is uh 41 so 120 120 guys lose it let me see where the clock [Applause] was nice hard clock yeah I'm liking this game so far it's uh it's good um

one [ __ ] h I make sure every stroke matters same uh importance a beginning and an end just like the work as a whole just like the various instruments in an orchestra the brush is one of many elements that create a beautiful Melody slightly annoying I don't know why mother was crying I took care of our problems mother did not understand so I took care of her as well I saw flashlight thing that's nice oh here we [Music] [Applause] [Music] go [Applause] [Music] sorry uh was that mom um I don't think that's safe I need an audience same ah I see I see I see I see dump the corpse in the

remember being a child and having my own little hide away in our crawl space anything to get away from him his fat disgusting body was too much for him to bother chasing me in there it didn't matter that I went without food for a few days anything was better than the constant beating and forced work on various art projects nothing could ever be good enough he with body wag to fight but body won it walks up right pick this ass from Arkham City whoa that's what it's been a while then he struggled with the hearts innocence and peace theart now as war on God begins at Str of midnight God shall

bit tired nobody cares I will I will hate it it doesn't matter so we can't really check this just yet cuz it's okay where did I see that with the clock like the 120 where did I see that does anyone

one too we need another one of those hands I'm sure of it I'm not sure but if we get the other hand then we uh jerk each other off then we can uh set the kitchen clock to 12 and maybe then it works but we need to find one more hand where am I going to find one more clock hand is there anything wait we haven't been to the dirt Cellar but we needed a battery for that that's probably where we escape maybe someone can land you a hand in this maybe small one no not here I've been there many times but we can check with the camera and uh storage room [Applause] thingy I don't think he needs any hand holding get through this hey so far I've been doing pretty well I'm proud of myself [Applause] here we haven't been here for a while you think so but on the other hand you guys are horrible God damn it it just keeps going okay there's literally nothing here someone could just like you know hand it [Applause] over think we're handling this very mature yeah yeah you are if you guys have any ideas you can let me know because you guys might not have the hands-on experience I have but you with your fresh take on things you know sorry uh this plaque was found in the kitchen the old pain is scratch triangle at two lines it's much heavier what the [ __ ] do I do with those oh wow hold up okay am I going to first try this probably not how do I do this C mother Char for more than any of victims she got some really good hits on me well I regret it uh it's probably one of the blue condemned okay okay condemned four let's add it let's add it condemned is uh is growing I can't believe it's not it's just not falling on any of them it's [ __ ] hilarious like okay um no it doesn't really show power them up yeah okay I got to power up the mannequins with the plaques how do I know which mannequin uses which plaque not the triangle but the pyramid well okay that worked Ah that's the battery is R yeah uh yeah uh yeah I found it thanks okay it tells you on the blueprint wait did I miss something on the blueprint I just brute forced it again this is the wrong one power them up best work yet no you guys yeah well I also brute forced one with almost 10,000 options [Applause] so you know nine is easy okay it wasn't actually a bruise Force still weird [Applause] though all right we heard some growling so uh see what the monster in uh over here is oh [Music] God hi I see you Welcome to My Little Getaway why don't you have a seat and play a game of chess with me no I don't know how chess is a phenomenal way of telling stories a niche yet intriguing form of art well it doesn't really work like normal chess in fact all you need to do is place the pieces in the right spots the Queen the mother of all the lands the king the disgusting and pathetic ruler the pawn the innocent child of the people tell three separate and beautiful stories with the characters I'm out I need the locations of all the aik the the the the thingies seven guest intro uh oh ah wow would you look at that that is the King right write this down A3 is King and then f8 is Queen and then G1 is spawn where's that a tower now that's a king it's in your Journal is it for lights oh it is that's nice that's nice this is locked right yeah okay maybe that's all I need so [ __ ] G1 for the pawn and the one with the cross is the king that is A3 then we [Music] have that's not it that's not it oh this is the queen me that is f8 oh okay that's part one this game is really fun like I should be going to bed but no I kind of want to finish this aren't they beautiful the whole Carter family is here we'll take that with us the drunker mom the vengeful father and the ill fated son okay so we have to do this puzzle now it's not adding anything to my notes so oh it is so this is the hold up let's read uh the father was a very charismatic man who wasn't ready for a long-term relationship when the child was born he had to give up his dreams in order to support the family he decided couldn't fulfill his dreams neither would his wife he became abusive and dealing with physical harm the only way for him to temporarily release his pain and dealing physical harm was the only way to deal with it okay brucees covered the child's body after all it was the kid's fault that he couldn't reach his dreams oh my God the mother once loving her husband lost everything in the marriage as the father isolated her from the rest of the world drinking was her only escape and usually ended up with a child taking the hits while not causing physical harm the child's mental scaring would be the end of him after all was the kid's fault that she lost everything what the [ __ ] G family was just like any other family a loving mother a supporting father and a cheerful child however these are the only observations from those on the outside looking at thead crumbling of the family one cold winter night the father had a realization if only the child was not around anymore he and his wife could go back to how it used to be a life filled with dreams we don't have enough yet to solve the puzzle but this one it's part of it no it's it's it's all part of [Applause] it but how do we know who killed wo and who who who's supposed to be where doesn't make sense to me know what I'm saying we don't have to last part still missing parts I think that's just we have to do more of the chess puzzle something change all right chewy calm down I don't see any more chest pieces like this was easy didn't change did it no [Music] um is that open now [Music] maybe what the crap maybe I do have to go [Music] back yeah I don't know I feel like if I go back I don't have enough [ __ ] [Applause] nice Forest yeah pretty location for a [Applause] house I just want to check it's the same [ __ ] note right no not this one this one yeah after the deed was done yeah this is we have the whole story of this how how the [ __ ] am I supposed to know how to do this the painting shows a pho figure standing in front of the fireplace warming his hand his empty and dark eyes hide the Dark Secret in front of the fireplace okay here we go this is it the painting shows a kid lying on the ground in front of the window mother is focused standing over the bed here we go guys I feel so good his eyes reminded me of myself so I made it quick and painless who's that Stalin disappointment Calvin was a great kid I always gave up on my mission and my Creations when I first saw his reaction to this world falling apart I could see myself in his eyes that same fear but alas it didn't take long for me to realize that he did he was broken but not broken [Music] enough handled it better whatever it was didn't I had to continue my work oh man artists are weird rest in peace now child your mother your mama you give him a finger to take your hand yep yeah my God how the [ __ ] does it not stop the cter is just like oh that's the whole story like nothing new [Music] Wasing the end of him yeah it's

turn out perfect black and gray the father's ashes easy to get it done with the r oils whites I tried grinding down a few of Father's bones but it turned out to be more mustard than I wanted so I had to bleach them first not perfectly white it was close enough for me yellow Charlotte's fat because it was already fatty it's hard to blend together with the usual oils I use but by drying it out in the sun for a few days worked pretty well this reminds me a lot of layers of fear Charlotte's lapis lazuli jewelry I tried for ages to figure out how to get any sort of blue dye from their corpses and in the end I had to give up luckily Charlotte played Minecraft uh had a few important pieces of lapis lazuli based jewelry in her possession to upgrade her her gear uh so at least the DI got a

so I was like we're just going to restart the whole game today we we only played for like 15 minutes so the only thing we did was basically get this and talk to some people there's money and a pen right I don't remember what to do with the pen it's going to be fun because I don't remember a whole lot my first playthrough took me about 10 hours I think you can play this if you know what to do you can finish it in an hour um all right let's talk to him so we are Steve and we have amnesia or something we just woke up we don't know where we are or who we are where we are and who we are right I did say that right you did watch it for me it such a good game it's one of my my favorites it's only my second play through all leave me alone seep or I'll tell Mom on you okay Mom Mom's in the

memory have not cut it out I'm telling you the truth this game has a lot of dialogue but it's beautiful dialogue leave me alone I'm sick you also have this old school 9s point and click feature where you can just type in stuff yourself like talk about twitch what yeah he doesn't know that because this is in the 50s they didn't have Twitch in the 50s I think think pretty sure have you noticed that your show isn't black and white what else color on a TV I think it's going to say it here right I think I've seen a color television before have not qu it I'm going to tell I think I Wass I don't know

last night pretty hard he stayed in bed I saw what she did to him it was pretty bad what did she like you don't know I saw you and her on the couch last Wednesday night guess that's why she's grounded

say hi to Mom hi Mom well hello there she's so creepies there's plenty of rejects in the trash who are you that's a fine way to talk to your mother you're my mother that's right right though sometimes I get treated like the hired help around here I don't remember you of course you don't until you need your socks washed so no you don't understand I can't remember where I am or even who I am L's sake stop your joshing won't you honestly Steve I thought youd grow up a little after graduation I only hope that new job will plant your feet on the ground so that's my name what my job again your name will be mud mud if you don't stop teasing me young man listen this may sound strange but I've lost my memory do you believe me well you always were a kider Steve I'm Ser always were a kider Steve sure and next you'll be telling me you don't remember Hank and your little sister all right so the actor who plays Steve he got jailed and I don't remember for what but it's I think it was assault it was [ __ ] up please it's a fun little uh fun little fact very fun um let's talk about graduation when did I graduate four months ago as if you could forget that what college College a high school diploma is all you need to get a job and besides you can't marry Stephanie if you're going to waste your time going to college 18 years old and you're just now getting your first job it's a disgrace but better late than never I guess we can thank Stephanie for that Stephanie and just who is Stephanie don't you dare toy with that sweet girl if you start in on her with all this Amnesia poop she'll think her fiance is having second thought Amnesia poop fiance fiance this is insane good his face not having second thoughts about marrying Stephanie is that what this silliness is all aboute wedding Jitters can something like that produce Amnesia that's one way to get out of it stop this foolishness right now and count your blessings Stephy is great at cooking and cleaning it was also like an Australian guy I think who faked his own kidnapping so he could be with his other wife it was that's the best thing I've read this week like I think he faked like u a message to his wife that he was kidnapped but he was going to be let go the next day so well his wife obviously like called police and stuff and he was just with another woman and he faked a kidnapping so he could be with her I mean that is that's some dedication there [Music] um cooking and cleaning what's cooking and cleaning got to do with anything honestly boys are so dense what else is there for a wife but cooking and cleaning you may not appreciate a plate when it's there but if it wasn't we'd hear about it soon enough I'll bet you're saying that's all there is to marriage cooking and cleaning well you'll um have to ask your father about that but I'm sure Stephanie will do her Duty when the time comes father my father he's in the other room he decided to sleep in today now please let me get back to my cookies cookies the bake sale is on Friday and yet you're baking the cookies now never put off till tomorrow what you can do today but they'll be stale by then that's why I'm throwing them away cing more to replace the ones I throw out what see well I have to no one's going to pay to eat stale cookies out of the garbage can you expect ni of course not Steve I'm charge you on your mother help yourself charity bake sale what charity is this bake sale supposed to benefit it'll help provide a fund for bums and hobos who wander into Harvest and have no family ties kind of a specific Target group isn't it you have to pay attention to detail when dealing with such people I don't know what you mean you will the whole thing has been organized by The Lodge tell me more about this bake sale why is it so important as I told you many unfortunates who come to harvest end up needing financial help why is that the thing Town's problem it's not a problem so long as those folks are taken care of it's the will of the lodge I don't remember why that that that whole cookie s is going on but we'll see all right the lodge what lodge the Hall of the order of the Harvest Moon Steve it's just the finest place in Harvest and the most exclusive what's so great about it hard to say since hardly anyone gets inside but it wouldn't be so exclusive if it wasn't just wonderful just like the new Reynolds dishwasher with their patented Auto Dry process TM I've never used one but I know I want it instead of sulking around the house all day why not walk over to the lodge and apply for membership why not that's wonderful Steve we left off yesterday if you got into the lodge you'd be the talk of harvest Harvest Harvest is a town unlike any you've ever known in what way I don't have time to go into it we still got to ask about my sister walk around town and pester someone else I'm busy hold up I think you can do this like Sister Sister shh you wake her I just put her down to sleep if she wakes up she'll just want eat again this is beautiful darn it I'm busy and if you think I'm going to play along with this nonsense you're crazier than Sparky down at the firehouse fine maybe I am am crazy I can't rule that out why can't you just help me a little is that too much to ask now you've done it are you happy poor baby get ready for the most beautiful thing ever did your brother scare you let me see such high production value so so well made darn that wasp woman she's a monster that's what she is this game's beautiful it's so good Michigan oh God where's Michigan here six looking good here we um we have 77 I think we're at like 90 we only need a few more to actually be like at uh 100 games because most of the a lot of these are also Series so that's good let's annoying all tabbing here so this game doesn't support obs's game capture so I have to monitor capture and once you all tap it becomes this little small dos box it's so annoying but it's worth it um wasp woman was tetsu AUM is going to hear about this I want you to go to her house right now and give her a piece of my mind okay I don't know where she lives honestly you can't miss house covered with paper nests Steve you tell her to M her own beeswax or buy golly I'll take it Bex get it cuz it's be lady BTA what's the PTA got to do with anything show some respect Steve the PTA has a lot of cloud in Harvest we run the charity bake sale the annual blood drive and by gosh we even have ties to the lodge annual blood drive yeah there's a lot you can ask her you knew how much blood we get you'd be more impressed donations are mandatory Steve if you're still here come Sunday you'll be expected to give until it hurts I suppose until it hurts even Hank will have to donate of course Lodge members are exempt remember that hey either way no one's sticking me with the needle we don't use needles okay I think we're done here put the out for Jimmy right put the papers out uh gu we can grab one here and then right Mouse click puts it in there all righty yeah this is our health indicator the more [ __ ] up he looks uh oh here here it says 53 that's what it is okay uh um this game has also has a manual save system so if you die you will see this screen and if you never saved you can restart your whole game so we're going to have to do this a lot uh intro and I am saving because I want to show you guys something specific here there's this cute little kid standing outside you think he's bringing the paper but he's he's taking your paper and if you punch him it will shoot you to [ __ ] like I said this game is beautiful it's so well made all right you guys thought Boulder's Gate was good nah nah this this is where it started all right this is that open world you can do everything game Boulder Gates wants to be all right okay we can I think we can just give him the paper here hey Steve I'm Jimmy James remember me remember me I guess not there now see how easy it is things are so much better between us when you remember the paper in the morning and let's keep him that way gotcha yeah um I never played the seven guest it's also on the list um I don't know if I should add the 11th hour too but um for now it's just a seven guest there's a frisbe on there see you later see you see you later alligator a security bars interesting depends if you like it or not I don't know if I really like this one then how can I not okay so I yesterday we were a bit stuck but I think what I have to do is meet Stephanie now right so we got we're going to talk to um all right what do you guys think this picture is what do you guys think it is um CU I can give you the description of it it's um the man of the house squeezing his meat yeah I would I would want that above my couch too steak being held up it's the man of the house squeezing his meat um there my future son-in-law and how's he doing today he looksy what brings him to the potam household huh huh I came over to see Stephanie oh [ __ ] can I try that again oh yeah Stephanie is grounded that's what he said I really need to see Stephanie potam grounded Stephanie so you'd better go ask her permission before you go upstairs sorry Steve the last thing I want to do is upset you and your father before the wedding not with the meat at stake not with the meat remind your dad about the meat W you and my dad is sick father I haven't se seen my father he's locked in a room he's not going to die is he like I said I don't know that woman mom tends to him herself well next time you see him be sure to tell him that I said hello and tell him that I'm praying for his speedy recovery and also would you remind him about the meat especially about the meat yeah fine man loves his meat if I see him you should should be more concerned if he dies then who's going to take over the slaughterhouse who's going to temp to the meat I guess as his son you'd take over right um meat meat is the foundation of any decent Society everyone needs at least three servings of red me today and anyone who says otherwise is a commi and what you're married to Stephanie I'll be part of the family too and your father will give me all the meat I want oh so that's why I'm marrying Stephanie so he can get his meat oh okay watch why are you so anxious to get into the lodge there's wonders inside I've heard there's more meat in there than they know this guy is so weird everyone in this game is honestly Steve you might go down to the post office and fill out a lodge application they're always looking for plus I think we're good here okay we got to ask for permission to see Stephanie have you floss [Music] today um you look just like my mom except for H you man can insult a woman without even knowing you've done it what a horrible thing to say sorry both standing around baking cookies same kind of dress same pearls so bizarre there's nothing bizarre about baking cookies the Harvest charity bake sale is Friday you know and by gosh Mrs Marvin poon Jr can be counted on to do her share um wait I need to ask her about Stephanie right sorry I didn't catch that really Stu funny sorry I didn't catch you don't know who your daughter is okay whatever pearls just because I'm doing doesn't mean I have to be AUD this sound here is so weird what's wrong with wearing pearls For Heaven's Sake nothing but you look like June Cleaver some kind of sitcom mom sitcom jeez you know a situation comedy the weird part is I can't remember how I know that I'm much too busy with housework to watch TV maybe Mr Pon would know about about sitcom well we can ask him Stephanie doesn't watch TV though she's grounded ground it Mr Pon feels there's too much at stake to allow Stephanie to run around luk she doesn't want to get married either huh are you saying you don't want to marry my daughter I don't know your daughter Mrs potam why is she grounded afraid she'll run away before the wedding no she's as delighted as we are about the wedding every bit as delighted as we are but she might get hit by a car or a falling piano or who knows what Mr Pon wants us all to be one happy family and he doesn't want to risk anything happening at the last minute hi fuu hi Jeffrey can I please see her I don't see any reason why not okay good good good we're allowed we're allow what's this this is Harvester it's the best game ever made it is the the goate tie of the 50s um mys to I think it came out in the '90s it is so good it's uh it's a full motion video game about a guy called Steve who wakes up with without any memories in a little town called Harvest we just started all we learned uh right now is that uh people in this town are weird um that we don't know anything and all we learned so far is that we um are going to marry a girl named Stephanie in two weeks and we're about to say hi to her I don't know I don't remember what room it is can't go in there no can I not open this made of Hightech topper workor TM is slowly releaseing no smelling chemicals into the hallway yeah we just started ceramic baby shoes oh oh oh I remember this hold up fin layer of herac Co virtual every inch of ceramic and a rubber duck yes seen better days nice okay so there is something really messed up here um there's a picture on the wall that's a bit crooked I don't know if I'm allowed to stream this but let's go yeah it's not too [Music] bad um someone is looking at Stephanie there's a little spy hole I think I had uh doesn't it change every time you look no it doesn't okay let's uh let's go say hi hi Stephanie who are you what are you doing in my room oh you heard we're getting married so you're the one Steve she has Amnesia too you mean you don't know me I mean I don't know anyone I don't remember anything how many times do I have to say it just one Stephanie because I can't remember a damn thing either really oh God I thought it was just me dress soon you're not alone can you tell me what's going on here those people downstairs have locked that's how fast I dress too though they say I'm grounded until the wedding uh ground it those people oh [ __ ] that's annoying if you click once to if you double click this is what happens no one will believe that have got an I believe you maybe some of these people believe you too maybe they're playing dumb why maybe they're responsible either way something really weird is going on here I've got to escape and so do you because in a way whether you know it or not I think we're both grounded I think we are grounded it's been hell they treat me well but they won't let me leave this room not even to go out in the yard not until the wedding they won't tell you why each one blames the other for grounding me they make up different excuses different things I did none of which I remember so I sit up here watch the world outside my window and listen to the noises in the house and you're being spied on um you heard or seen anything is might help figure this thing out every morning a weird Boy comes to the house and picks up he doesn't deliver the paper he picks up scrap paper that Miss potam sets out on the porch for him some morning she forgets and the boy gets Furious oh I know I know gives me the Crepes anything else you can tell me I hear these weird scraping sounds in the bathroom sometimes like something is sliding along the wall claws maybe and Mr pot Stam I don't like the way my dear daddy looks at me both of them are always watching me especially him you don't think they're dangerous do you this is messed up the whole place is dangerous I think we've got to escape before it's too late Daddy has been spying and gross Escape Escape Harvest is a prison Steve don't forget that yep I think you're right of course I'm right oh sorry laod everything in Harvest seems to revolve around this damned Lodge this order of the Harvest Moon they're responsible for this insane bake sale that's coming and for the harvest blood drive too when people talk about the lodge it's always in this hushed reverent tone mom keeps telling me that women can't join but she keeps pressuring me to get you to join she's not the only one who wants me to sign on with the lodge that's probably the worst thing you could do I'm doing it anyway is some kind of trap I think all of harvest is a trap that's true maybe joining the lodge is the way out look why not explore the town a little I can't get out of here but if I could that's what I'd do maybe you can figure out what's happening here without going anywhere near the lodge you're really afraid of the lodge aren't you I look at that building all lit up at night and I get scared I mean look at the damn thing seem like a harmless bunch of Masons to you just random random cutcenes in [Music] between um amesia maybe my Amnesia isn't total after all there's a lot of talking in this game yeah like we've met before in another life maybe we really do live here maybe we were together and the same thing happened to both us Al not a visual novel it's um there's definitely gam us has bumps on our heads if that's what you're getting at have you been able to remember anything else I mean anything at all well I have had these recurring Dreams Just fragments really strange abstract images liquid chrome probably just a dream well have you thought about how to escape Harvest okay I think we I think that's everything for now I'm going to have to think about what's next we could go to the post office because that's where you get the applications I [Music] think the fluid every time she talks okay there there's a lot of sounds in this game that are so annoying if you're going to focus on them I think every sound it's horrible if it isn't my favorite Sun can we talk about that bathroom stop mumbling oh beg pardon you've got a peephole in the upstairs bathroom it looks in on Stephanie's room well I'll be darned it's not going to kill me right obviously Mrs B them is a lesbian oh my God you've been spying on your daughter haven't you how dare you I'm no peeping Tom I had no idea that was there then you won't mind if I tell Stephanie about it now there's no need to scare Stephanie with this business I guess not so long as you patch that hole well I guess I could hang that picture somewhere else I thought you had no idea where it was got him okay so I guess it's time to save again B done resence so you can easily soft lock yourself in this game eventually so I'm going to have to make a lot of saves after each other so we can always like refer if we need to um okay we I guess we go uh explore a bit I think we start at the post office because we need the the lodge application anything I can do outside here oh God a blind woman is trying to read her meal yeah that's what they do um Yes she'll be there for a while I guess um hello yes I need some help Mr postmaster Bo what can I do for you today he seems nice I'd like a large application I'm sorry youngster we're out of applications right now come on you must have one around here somewhere well I do have the master but you can't write on that and I only make copies once a month on the button regular Clockwork on the button won't kill you to make a Lous of copy it's not the effort son it's the principle we must adhere to our standards they're all that stand between civilization and Chaos I'm sorry you'll just have to come back in a month same as anyone else and even then I can't guarantee you'll get an application the line is always long and they are never enough to go around it's very important that I get in quickly that's what they all say postmaster Bo I'll just die if I don't get get into the lodge I can't make an exception young man just wouldn't be right okay next time you post don't forget the ZIP code so this is I think the part where you have to go pretty much all around town to try and find stuff that will eventually get you it's been so long I don't I don't remember anything um see at the General Store for oh tape and broken glass obviously a professional Breakin Fram asparagus tips two for 50 cents let me see what we can buy here again we have 25 [Music] cents can I help you dear who are you this is

him one though I know his wife for heaven's sakes well will you sell me one I certainly will Steve that kind of interest is healthy for a young fell stares him away from being a fireman yeah maybe we

remember me heard about that short in the old wiring I'm Fire Marshall Sparky head of your fire department where did you hear about my memory loss don't be silly everyone thinks that Amnesia kick is a scream well you always were a kid or Thief besides it's of development in the community to better serve you the public I'm sure you'll Beed when you learn of the many Civic improvements we have planned for your fire department such as well don't tell any of the others but I've secured a bolt of the most Divine MO material I've hidden it because well if any of these marries got a hold of it it'd be gone with a jiffy so I'd rather keep it hush hush I'm going to make new drapes for the firehouse and if I have any left cross your fingers I'm going to make everyone matching mauve pillow cozies those are Civic improvements don't be such a party we're talking about our what is that je we haven't had a fire in Harvest so life of steo it is it is really weird I'll admit that the was Woman's Place is one big accident waiting to happen right still going to go there useless cut scenes gra a fire department there's an half naked man sitting in the middle and they're painting it's it's so weird all right let's talk about the newspaper a dreadful Affair you wouldn't think that a brick and steel building with a sprinkler system could go up that quickly how you doing steo welcome in you think it was arson oh please Dwayne was glad enough to see the thing go up and so was mcnight if you could get into that sa and his wall forget it look as far as I know the fire was an accident let's just leave it at that right how don't you go [Laughter] moving uh okay the was woman some people think all we do is sit around sketching fetting examples of manhood for our Amusement nothing could be further from the truth why just the other day we cited Ted to a crumb for fire coat violations all the dried out paper W Nest clustered around her wooden house why it's a chem just waiting for the right [ __ ] believe me none of us wants to see another Fiasco like the Sentinel fire did to talk about that again a dreadful Affair you wouldn't think that a brick and fly keep sitting on me yeah sadly it's only flies people look like YouTubers I don't think they had YouTube back in the that time but maybe they are now I think most of them are dead though um drawing to put it out in time enriches the community theve no less than a puling fire hose or beating down a blazing door what if drawing a nude man so what if all we ever draw is a nude man or the same nude man over and over in all sorts of provocative positions context not content proc not subject don't be so ghost D it's beneath you okay I think uh that's enough by byebye I don't converse on the job steeve oh okay don't bother me I'm sketching oh look what you made me do okay um cool cool cool cool this is what I did before Justin TV I guess they did huh how do I go back this way um this is the burnt down newspaper I don't think we can do anything now let's go to the police station cop ignores you too busy writing a bug report the bug report let me uh make a safe again don't know why empty empty unsolved arson and it's full unsolved murders and it's full let's talk to sheriff hell Steve let me introduce myself I'm Sheriff Dwayne Dwayne dway DNE pleasure I reckon oh he likes the nud mag met before course we have but I heard about your alleged Amnesia and figured I'd play along I sure sure hope this is just a prank and not the start of some Insanity game is a prank keep your nose clean or you'll wind up in jail and that's no place to hold a wedding amum why do you want to break your poor mama's heart with all this Amnesia bunk I'm telling you the truth Why Won't Anyone believe me well you've always been a kter Steve yeah so everybody keeps telling me boy you need to stop all this funing and get serious you've got a wedding coming up soon heck you should be thinking about your career and about joining the lodge like you guys are not going to believe this but what if I tell you the story is actually good like the ending it's going to blow your minds trust me okay a wedding Amnesia or no you can't have forgotten you're about to marry the prettiest little thing thing at Harvest I think you and Stephanie are perfect for each other I just hope her father's disappointment doesn't spoil everything disappointment Mr Potsdam wants to hold the wedding in The Lodge but he'll never get in like all the rest he's always hanging around the post office the first day of the month waiting for Bole to bring out that month's locations there's always a long line Never Enough applications to go around and even if you do get an application chances are you're right out of BL fewer called to the order and even less accepted and potam well they've turned him down so many times unless he does something radical he'll never get in something radical okay let's talk about crime crime wise nothing much has happened in Harvest since the newspaper fire oh [ __ ] so it is a crime every week or so we get the odd train it dropping dead but other than that it gets pretty slow around here about the newspaper firing sure you remember the Sentinel building burned down about 6 months ago that's what I'm telling you Sheriff I don't remember anything why won't you believe I have amnesia right well you've always been a kider Steve anyway the fireman said the fire was caused by arson I never caught the per though but we found the gas can that was used yes sir EOP it's in the evidence room that's classified darn it how many times you going to have to tell me to keep my mouth shut I wonder Sorry boss you've got the gas in the got get did you dust it for Prince you've been watching too much TV Steve heck who can make out all those curvy lines anyhow no it's sitting in there Gathering dust clean is the day we found it just in case I ever need a spare gas can that case is close Steve well please never changed um Lumis Lumis here is my Deputy without him I'd have a hard time keeping the pieace or at least taking a lunch break mainly Lumis and the phone and babysits the office while I'm out though sometimes he likes to go in the back and stain the jail mattress isn't that right lumus oh now Sheriff what you got to go and say that F getting obvious his share of problems I wouldn't invite him to the wedding or if you do make sure he doesn't catch the Garter that could be embarrassing oh I would wouldn't do nothing Dwayne but I sure would like a little garer than been around Stephanie's thigh oh well that'd be right forgot how nasty this game is cuz um you know Stephanie is 17 I think um stop on by any time I think that's it anything I can help you with that coffee sure smells good help yourself speaking of which you're real lucky to be marry and Stephanie she don't look like a good woman I just hope she don't turn out like Mrs lumus her mercy for Phelps good women can be awful hard on a man's needs don't you know okay a man's needs let talk about that you sure ought to appreciate what a man's got to do sometimes in a park car or wasti high KN hole in a tree or jail cell at noon matter f Mrs phelp got no reason three hours later can you move it along I'm all out of time C your books yeah this is the game enjoy SE clear to par with them bring him around when the sheriff's at lunch and I'd be obliged okay he has to go to lunch first then we can give him the nudie magazine yes dick that's what he was talking about I got to move that so it doesn't walk Mrs Fels down at the General Store don't help things none she's got them special picture books the one with the lady I got one but she won't sell me nothing on account that she knows my wife Mrs Lumis that gum if that don't burn my britches if and I even ask about him she tells Mrs lumus and I get the broom enough to break a man's heart her burning my French post cards we unable to replace them a man's got needs don't you know don't you know French postcards course I don't necessarily mean French postcards that's just what we called them in my day any kind of girly picture book The Kind men like would be those things still sell like nude magazines if you were to bring me one no right nobody buys that anymore in a time okay we got to wait till the sh is out for lunch and then we can actually just sneak into the evidence room I guess that's the evidence room where we store items lifted from crime scenes it's kept locked at all times there's things in there that could make people jump through hoops if I wanted so it's locked okay well we have to come back here so I think our goal right now is to just meet the town people people and uh basically you know get hints we can save it over save it there get hints because now we know we can use the nudy magazine here to get into the evidence rooms while Dwayne is out for lunch um we know more about the newspaper building we can't I don't think we can really do anything here that's just ashes this nothing we can do here right now um we could go to atma's diner 1955 fra 100 with a real letter SE nice DNA Diner wait Sheriff Dwayne is here now what talk to Karen hi what's your name Karen what are you doing playing my mom is working so I got to stay out of her hair want to play not now maybe later okay bye-bye bye-bye hi Sheriff hello there Steve here for lunch no just here looking around though I'm not entirely sure where here is oh I forgot you're playing your little Amnesia prank well boy this is DNA's Diner isn't that right Edna don't listen to sheriff Dwayne this is Edna's Diner but ever since the E burned out on the sign they've been giving me a hard time now don't be like that Edna it's a great place to eat which is good since it's the only place to eat and harvest yeah that makes it uh stop on a good place to eat I at now oh Steve what are you doing sneaking up you just talk to me God for a second I thought you were Mr Johnson would you like to meet Mr Johnson uh who are you well you're in Edna's Diner that ought to be your first clue I thought this was DNA's Diner yeah exactly very funny if certain customers would stop pretending to have amnesia and order some food maybe I could afford to get that sign for fixed might even be able to buy enough extra letters to spell Fitzpatrick I'm not pretending now Steve faking Amnesia won't help any she look so mad if you don't want to marry Stephanie then don't but don't play sick For Heaven's Sake I'd expect that from Karen not an 18-year-old Mr Johnson Mr Johnson has a a liking for me I'd call it a crush but that's too innocent a word he's a bitter man with too much time on his hands he's never gotten over being rejected by the lodge and there's something UNH wholesome in the way he looks at me I'm always glad when the sheriff comes every day at noon the lodge the lodge is the repository of all wisdom you should join the order of the Harvest Moon Steve and soon why for God's sake what is it about this place place the wheat ripens and waits not for the side the farmer who Waits too long it would better that he used the side to rip his own stomach out than to stay his thth when the wheat ripens amen Harvest Moon waines and then comes winter an empty belly the body Sun's belly gurgling within or bloody on the ground what does it benefit a man if he gains his soul and loses the world yeah this is definitely not a weird cult Village feed yourself before it's too late oh people here are fine Steve what happened were we talking

the batch on him post office button my button why I lost that months ago where did you find it funny thing that I found it in the ashes at the newspaper building what are you implying that I had something to do with setting the fire Preposterous why 100 people must have visited that site since the fire but none of them had buttons like this all right cut the crap and what if I did I guess I'd be pretty grateful to anyone who could help get me off the hook how you seem like a capable lad H pathetically let's say there was a gas can sitting in the evidence room hypothetically let's say I have it gas can which might have some incriminating prints on it someone might be very grateful for the return of that gas can say grateful enough to provide whoever returned it with a large application oh and Steve you'll keep this to yourself if you're smart I always was a kider uh let's hypothetically say that I have this gas can in question and give it to oh my God I can't believe it after all this time where's my application Bo here here take it with my thanks you know this morning as I was making my rounds I noticed an awful lot of Television Aerials on the roofs seems like more and more each day you got me this can just in time youngster I may have need of it again what do you mean uhoh there's another reason why Sheriff Dwayne didn't investigate the Sentinel fire if you'd like to get something else on the blackmailing bastard check around the tel teleion station why are you still can okay I guess he's planning on burning it down do I have to large application yes oh that is so hard to read are you allergic to any of the following letter gunpowder latex what I can't read the rest have you ever had proud of what the hell is that know any physical disabilities that prevents it from calling next what I I don't know anyway let's sign it I I got to P that's a ticket oh [ __ ] what the hell happened enter okay um let's save uh signed do I have to like just deliver it here is he going to do the rest for me that interests me not at all okay I guess we have to go to the Lo watch itself wait watch yeah yeah guess so um okay sorry son no time to talk we could check out there there's a few things I want to check out I want to check out the Wasps lady see if we can find something there haven't been there yet there a lot of place we haven't been yet and we uh yeah the TV station I don't remember where the was place he is abandoned house I think both cars perfect nasty grounds for wasps well I guess [Music] um we're at the right place here okay hello anything I can get here the sound of it these governs are infested with wasps you know what let's not hello it's not often that I get visitors are you the WASP woman I am tetu AUM ignorant Harvest close to this place woman a badora no doubt born of fear and a Poverty of a imagination I don't understand the politics of Honey the judeo-christian rights of sacrifice and conventional taboos against unbridled pleasure are all responsible for the prejudice against wasp yeah right okay pleasure yes a great deal of pleasure the WASP is a sensual being not a labor do you ever see a wasman just industrial some think them quick to anger in truth they are easily sway to ecstasy they penetrate your flesh and the muscular contraction this is your as they pump Venom could be likened to the muscular contractions of ejaculation each painful wel an act of love you guys are missing out on the best moments not enough Channel points ah [ __ ] well sucks to be sucks to be you um wasps regard the wasp wasps produce nothing for others but only for themselves wasps spill nests and more wasps nothing more they spread into EES and addicts not to make honey for supermarkets but to buzz and rustle on their own paper perpetuating their own agenda growing this chick so weird surely the most Relentless of [Music] insects keep them away from innocent children innocent children what better way to describe the WASP Carefree wild beautiful things if they wish to share their love with babies or any of the rest of you ignorant Hicks that is not my concern okay um sacrifice when a be SS it rips itself apart and dies for its audacity this appeals to those raised too much yeah that happens on TV demand sacrifice and atonement but the WASP is promiscuous they are not as sympathetic to the masses because they don't die when they sting they live to sting another Dead really was don't die when a sting I thought they would also die pleasure from it was are dicks all right so I think what we can do is safe wasp [ __ ] no load game let's try that again oh [ __ ] I thought I thought he damn it hate this game sometimes it's so bad but it's so beautiful hold up I just want to show I want to see that cut scene I don't remember it I just remember you could like kill her yeah yeah so um I don't remember it correctly but I think the was blady is just completely useless and this is you can kill her and it won't change anything but just in case because this game can get very weird kill the wrong people I'm going to leave her alive cuz I don't I'm not 100% sure about that uh let's uh yeah yeah this uh see I told you like balers gate ain't got nothing on this game um Johnson residence we haven't been there yet hi Mr Johnson oh he's not creepy at all to other than having no memory I guess I'm all right all right you should be ecstatic considering what you're getting into if you haven't gotten into it yeah he's also [ __ ] creep speaking of which I heard Stephanie was grounded her daddy's worried about getting his me so if I were him I'd be more concerned about Stephanie getting some meat uh right and you are you always were a kid or Steve I'm Mr Johnson remember glad you stopped by just got finished waxing the Tucker is that what they call it now I use a little relaxation waxing the Tucker but since Ed is not here I might as well talk to you Ed know Edna Fitzpatrick is one of the [Music] DNA she's got all these high flutin ideas about independence and her with a little girl toas that child needs a father and Edna well she needs a good hard penis penis what makes you so sure she needs a penis you sing it is getting it from someone else like maybe that damn Sheriff Dwayne Dwayne he's over at DNA's Diner every day from noon to 1 he dead gum pie and I got a feeling he'd like end for dessert sure it's the in town but I'm sure he's got more his M food I'll admit DNA's done it does good business but money isn't everything to woman money keep you warm at night yes can you wrap your thighs around it yeah R bloody gases in its back with your ped holl what the [ __ ] calm down Jesus so how's Stephanie uh Stephanie speaking of Stephanie I still haven't gotten an invitation to the wedding yet that's Weir I don't have anything to do with that that's okay personally I'd prefer a pass to the honeymoon you could use the back seat of my Tucker for oh my God look at his face Voyage it's plenty big believe you me I'd drive you around and I wouldn't look in the back seat I guarantee it though if you'd like to come up front and take the wheel a while I wouldn't say nay uh Tucker heck of an automobile isn't she damn shame I have to sit out here and watch over her all the time but if I didn't those stupid kids might scratch her up playing ball um could I take a look at it why not but don't touch her I'm Mighty particular about my Tucker I had the garage remodeled like a fortress so I could lock her up at night and get some sleep I'm sure she's safe enough inside a few months back someone broke into my house trying to get into the garage I had to gripe like hell before the sheriff agreed to start the evening patrols and instigate the curfew I remember that I remember that I think we're good oh yeah we got to get into garage uh some at some point anyway let's deliver the application I guess hello I see you've managed to acquire an application that demonstrates resourcefulness a desirable trait for prospective members you need a rest report back here for your next assignment okay uh cigarettes were really cheap back in the day that's why it sounds like that

like the [ __ ] Town's Criminal wait burnt flyer should would my mom know anything about that it's about the bake sale right mom stop wasting my time young man God damn it trying to be a detective okay oh my God there's so much we can do um we could get our assignments at the lodge I take it you wish to be initiated into the mysteries of the order of the Harvest Moon damn right uh yes I want to know what you know very well know then that securing the application was but the first step on your road to Enlightenment now you must complete a series of tasks to prove your worthiness as an initiate what kind of tasks minor pranks really nothing overly difficult more tests of wit than prowess but complete them you must prank if you wish to enter these walls minor prank eh I'll bet what have you got in mind there is in Harvest a man named Mr Johnson he owns a Tucker it is his pride and joy I should like you to put a scratch in it a scratch that's all as I said a minor prank mind you you are not to damage the vehicle merely put a single scratch in it okay once you have done so return here and I shall give you your next task scratch the the car all right do we already have anything for that I don't remember this uh save game scratch car I don't think I can do that right now he's sitting right there let do with a key hey what the hell are you doing yeah we're not we're not okay that that needs to happen at night I think so we got to do other stuff first um go to the Meat Plant we we haven't really done that part yet there's a lot of cats here I wonder why oh that's why this used to be a kitty cat you know some people just really like cats so much they eat them uh what's up Pat O'Reilly Steve how's your father is he better I don't know about the same I guess he's been away from work for weeks and when I call your house your mother won't let me talk to him I haven't seen him either this is a fine kettle of fish I must say though I am glad to see you taking an interest in the business in your dad's absence who are you a Steve I didn't to believe that Amnesia hok now you're saying you don't remember your pal Pat O'Reilly pal family business you may come to realize that this business is not for everybody just ask your poor ill dad it takes dedication and a strong stomach a lot of times when I finish scrubbing up and digging the bits of intestine out from my fingernails I must confess I don't have much appetite for red meat but red meat is one of the principal food groups and you got to have it so when you can do this all day and help yourself to a juicy red steak afterwards then by golly you can call yourself a butcher yeah it's all vegan by one of course Amnesia would certainly help that wouldn't it that's illness what exactly is wrong with your dad I don't know I wouldn't worry about it too much Steve you should be thinking about running the family business one day that getting into the lodge uh meat come to think of it I don't see any cattle around here where do you keep the animals does it matter prodct is all the customer cares about Steve and we only carry the finest meat only the juiciest cup that was unnecessarily loud once you take over the business you'll realize the importance of maintaining quality while cutting cause we know what we're doing here if we didn't would the lodge use us to cater their Affairs um could I have some meat your father's very particular about the prophet Steve no freebies for anyone but seeing how you're his son if you'll bring written permission from your father I'll give you the meat all right Dad going I have your colleagues meet huh watch the order of the Harvest Moon sponsors a Weenie Roast on the lodge grounds every summer which we cater a Weenie Roast tend to get their meet elsewhere the rest of the year I wonder why heck the best way to find out is to sign up with them they're a great organization Steve they do wonderful work just like us butchers they do what needs to be done and expect nothing in return like key and car how do they support themselves membership dues from what I hear the work is its own reward you may come to realize that this business is not for everybody just ask your poor ill de and a strong stomach okay yeah so useless all right so we need a written permission slip then by yeah wait Mr Po them had something right don't read you Steve don't read you Steve okay I guess not don't be such a all right so well we can't get to my dad yet we need a philli screwdriver we don't have one of those let's go to school yeah okay I remember this now that I see this I I'm starting to remember that's the broom closet we can open soon can't we go into a classroom first I thought we could maybe because it's all done and I have the key now upright the fire alarm hold up let me uh let me save here what if I upgrade the fire alarm the glass read sorry for the delay on making this alarm active big guy Sparky I can't okay whatever um hello [Laughter] get [ __ ] busted huh what screwing in the school broom closet what will people think are you blackmailing us you little [ __ ] yes calm down Mr Harold Steven would never do that he's a smiley bear but we should give him a token of our appreciation for his silence here Steven take this baseball bat you quite useful I think this photos work more than more than that you won't get we don't have much money we're Educators not okay okay wise decision Steven take the bat and we'll take the photo that only gives me a bat H I think a b the bat is just a weapon think I could do anything specific with that we still off the picture now no oh I got the permission slip can can't I sign it [Music] myself okay okay well that didn't work man damn it Dam so nostalgic these sounds okay um let's talk to good of you to drop by big guy I've haven't seen you since graduation a lot of changes I hear you could say that good good that's a nice part of my job turning fine young men and women out into the world and then watching them Prosper of course I was able to reach more people at the old Sentinel God bless her but then again I never got to see the results of my work up close before who are you you know very well I'm Mr Herold the principal of gain memor Memorial Steve I've heard about this Amnesia nonsense everyone did I had hopes you'd be in the lodge by now fine young fell like yourself but now I think maybe you need a little more quality time oh my God why is everyone so creepy here quality time what do you mean with quality time me quality time some like Miss whey favors Stern discipline corporal punishment as a means of social each their own myself I temper discipline with love love quality time can be such a warm sharing experience few SS you'd stop this Amnesia nonsense and become a productive member of society and a fit candidate for the LW working on it working on it watch big guy born some quality time the greatest gift I can bestow upon you as your former principal is a word of advice join the order of the Harvest Moon at any cost within the lodge lies your future and without dust okay big guy why do you keep calling me big guy a sign of respect lad as principal my station is higher than your now but you never know what the future holds so you should always HED your bets and pay tribute to your inferiors you never know who will come to power or who even now wields it behind the scenes for all I know you might already to be a member of the order with access to the lodge if that were the case you'd be my Superior and I'd be all that much better

air ra drill everyone into the hallway [Music] quick I guess she had a spare baseball [Music] bat if an a bomb hits what good is it going to do to Duck and [Music] Cover this is why I love this game it's [Music] beautiful and that's going to give me nightmares stars that was exciting LOD this Lodge what do you know about it the building itself like Harvest was constructed with a specific purpose in mind that Noble intent is known only to those within the order you're at about the right age to join them Steven and you will do so if you care about your [Music] future can you tell me anything about Harvest Harvest was founded by the order of the Harvest Moon about 100 years ago for what purpose why I'm sure you'd have to ask them you'll find the members of the order at the lodge okay stop by anytime [Music] Steven I'm just going to look up what I have to do with with this [ __ ] game I am actually going to Google if I am stuck because you have no clue how hard this is and I already

hammer though oh I don't need one well that didn't work okay does that lead to the garage nothing here right cans oil pan I think this is the garage oh yeah all right so there is something really stupid here I I remember this so well because it is so hard to see somehow but there's a screwdriver you can pick up here you know it's there it's easy but if you don't it's so easy to miss I don't think there's anything else though man he loves this car uh the broom I think or the Pitchfork there's something here yeah okay got a dolly I think that's it now we can just key the car was it with the key was it with a screwdriver yes did it did it hi Tyrell CU it screws with you I yep I guess so there's nothing else right I don't want to miss a thing that's what Aerosmith once said too how you doing Terrell um how do I get oh right underneath I think we're I think we're done just go to the lodge now that's all I have to do right so you have completed your first task now that you've scratched the Tucker you may proceed to your second task right you will steal a bolt of fabric from the firemen and bring it to me um okay very well then use whatever means necessary but bring okay we need the cloth wow I don't remember how though nice I'm so glad it's October guys my favorite [ __ ] month it's my vacation month so at the end of the month I won't be here for a full [Music] week but

able to stream again I don't know how bad my jet lag is going to be who knows all right let's get the paper let's um save the game and it's day three see you later see you later alligator I got a newspaper for you hey St you've been doing a swell job putting the paper out in the morning all right dude wait wait wait wait wait we can do this now right with the Phillips one [Music] Oh [ __ ] forgot about that I am uh I'm jailed or using a screwdriver on my own house this is your first arrest Steve you just remember we've got a three strikes you're out rule here in Harvest but you keep your nose clean that was my own [Applause] house um okay this game is so weird this good Lord okay um what was next okay so I'd have to get rid of the security first I think I need a ladder for that wasn't that at the barber shop we haven't been there yet we could just go say hi [Music] ah the [Music] barber hello I can't talk to him okay this guy oh [ __ ] I didn't mean to howdy Steve nobody cares howdy [Music] back too bad look I'm going to I'm going to reload this I don't want to kill anyone I didn't mean to I just wanted to talk to him jeez oopsie there now let's try that again don't press right Mouse button it's not smart SM okay I really can't talk oh Mr past doesn't respond not understanding English okay how about Mr SW yeah howdy back Mr Pete SW Steve don't you pull my old leg now change your mind about that aluminum siding what are you talking about I really think you should talk your father into buying some he can afford it and I can't stress enough the value of some really fine aluminum siding keeps it warm in the summer cool in the winter and it keeps out the Sheep oh that's ought to look into some but I can't get him to understand the word I say too bad about Edna's daughter going missing that was a strange night oh that's already happening I remember that evening the pot stam's upstairs bathroom toilet backed up I've seen folks UPS said about that stuff but Mr pot dam was just furious heck they even got a downstairs bathroom but when I told him it'd take most of the night to fix he stormed out of the house some folks are hard to figure okay so po down thanks this I think this guy nice just only talks about aliens okay somehow hello there youngster you say them aliens I was telling you about well they came back last night cut another crop circle in my Southfield how come I never seen none of them saucers clam them aliens is wild they Pete you don't cross the intergalactic void without learning a trick or two you know what Pastor really did yesterday he gets an alarm system to protect his pole only he don't know how to rig it so now it's all a a danging if the whole town ain't going to hell poor old Johnson defecating a work of art like that well that's a sheer sign that Civilization is coming to an end yep I he Ed's daughter up and disappeared Tuesday night yes sir aliens got her for sure sorts of funny things went on that night I seen three different UFOs over my Fields well weird is they didn't carve anything there was lights in the cemetery and swell was busy that night too tell them about it Pete oh he don't want to hear about [Music] Tuesday I don't really have to so po down right we got to know where Mr ban was last night what was my next assignment again all right the cloth yeah that's it's also a night thing I think oh my God this sucks so bad hi Mr Bon did you say hello to your father for me yes thank God for that at least I could use some good news right now I just got the word the order turned down my latest application looks like we'll be having the wedding at morning hands after all so what's new Steve um Edna's daughter Karen is missing anyone do something so terrible to her you think someone took her I think oh no see it was a kidnapping haven't you heard the sheriff got a ransom note seems someone wants to dip into Edna's l too bad such a sweet little thing has to suffer well where are you Tuesday night that was a terrible night our upstairs toilet backed up Pete swell came over and fixed it my back still sore from helping me carry his stuff up the stairs someone wom and scraped up Johnson's car you imagine I know he'd step in a bear trap and his own leg off rather than suffer a scratched Tucker serves the rich bastard right if you ask me you didn't really say where he was right I mean I know where he was because we already played it okay I am starting to realize this is maybe not the best game for a replay because if you know where to go and what to do you kind of skip a lot so I'm sorry for that okay my my first actual first playthrough is also unused YouTube from 2020 hello dear to see if you want to see like everything this game has to off but I'm obviously automatically just skipping stuff because I she's upst I know stuff go right on up have you heard that Edna's daughter Karen has disappeared these things happen we just have to deal with them step by step one day at a time where were you Tuesday night why let me think oh yes that was the night our upstairs bathroom toilet backed up Mr swell was kind enough to come over and fix it fors it took most of the night then you and Mr poom were both home oh yes we rarely step out on week nights Mr Pon and I just used the downstairs facilities and stayed in the rest of the night and floss together in full sight of each other at all times and everything was fine just fine yes all right I don't believe that keep my regards to your uh I guess we can go to Stephanie we don't have to but I think maybe she has some new dialogue and stuff is the hole fixed I don't think they're ever fixing that this is a new one [Music] right you're welcome [Music] chat um okay hi Steve I'm so glad you came back what have you been doing giving magazines Sergeant arms there he knows that there's something out of whack here he told me if I wanted to find out what it is I should join the lodge I've decided to join the lodge Stephanie I think the answer to all our questions is inside that place it's so Sinister maybe but I got to join anyway playing right into their hands did you think of that doesn't it seem like you're being hurted toward the lodge that's one of the things I hope to find out I hope finding out doesn't get you killed my fa mother keeps me up on the latest gossip not like she really wants to talk to me more like she's feeding me information for instance she told me that Mr Johnson's Tucker was vandalized that's another weird thing yeah super weird every car I've seen Drive By is a Tucker there were only 31 produced what are the odds of that I've always wanted a Tucker funny that Harvest would be full of them any idea who scratched the car funny the Harvest is full of [ __ ] while he always wanted one uh I did why would you do something like that it's part of the lodge initiation I see look I don't know what's going on here why is that part of it just I see by committing vandalism there we go by any means necessary well I guess you'll fit right in won't you scratching a car is no big deal getting out of this mess is sorry when you put it that way I guess I was over reacting I understand that a little girl is Missing that's right her name's Karen I heard the Pod parents talking about it downstairs when did it happen Tuesday night God that was a bad night for everyone Tuesday our upstairs toilet backed up so as if that wasn't bad enough Mr potam was livid almost irrational like the toilet had it in for him personally through the wall I kept hearing him ask somebody named Mr SW whether the toilet would be fixed by dark and when swell said it'd take most of the night to fix daddy totally lost it swell said he'd stay all night and fix it but that didn't seem to help pot Stam stormed out of the house and didn't come back till next morning but where did he go Mrs postam told me that postam didn't go out on Tuesday night well I'm not lying I saw him through the window Just Before Dawn when he stepped beneath the porch light I could see he was covered with mud one weird night guess all hell broke loose didn't [Music] it come back and visit me soon okay I don't know if that is the hint you're supposed to get and find is where can I talk about mud stop M no that'd be too futuristic now okay I know where he went I don't know if if other people are going to be clearer about I don't remember can I [ __ ] leave there we go um I guess we just go there because I know [Music] where nothing else I can do right we could we could still go to the TV

station hey wh is the only television station in Harvest since the old Sentinel went under what with the newspaper building burning down and all we're golden nobody competes with us sport what an odd coincidence hey now sport that's an irresponsible allegation I had nothing to do with that fire just because wh may have benefited from it and I danced on the ashes a little doesn't mean I torched the place you can ask Sheriff DNE you give me doubts you seem awfully touchy on the subject sport I'm touchy when people try to muscle their way into my business sorry I'd appreciate if you leave my office and don't come back all right I guess we just go to to find Caren now don't know if I have to say safe but yeah Cemetery um salmon grave asone off Jonathan a r Cliff fresh soil it's not there

know what to look out for the hobby horse and the [Music] jello oh God this man is traumatized you need your rest yes rest but why did you come you must have had a reason for risking it I need some meat and Pat won't give me any without your signed permission good old Dependable Pat here son here's my signature take it to him and you won't have any problem now go son go quickly before she comes back so we got a sign slip now okay very cool now we can get the meat and we need the meat to distract the dog in the fire station and then we have to get the cloth somehow and I don't really remember

remember I could place the ladder somewhere here okay all right oh that's actually it I it it was in the wall light okay wow okay I got it this is the weirdest [ __ ] puzzle ever it's because I played this before that I somewhat knew what was going on but this is where people usually quit the game and never come back to it because it's stupid someone suggestive it is it is this game is uh quite strange it's a game I already played earlier so I'm not going to wander around too much because I weirdly enough still remember what to do which makes this game a bit weird to play I could spend hours and hours talking to everyone but we we got games to play just wanted to show you guys this one all right skip this I don't can I give you the autograph I don't remember this who Steve I think I do remember it yeah okay anyway um newspaper hey St um okay I think I mean yes I have the money um trying to think of what I have to do without a guide um I think I have to buy everything at the store save up day four so I could give you the money take what you need okay we can get everything so that's this and a wrench and that's all I think I don't need this don't need this okay go [Music] back um let me check the guide I don't really remember I'll play all the other games that I play for the first time without a guide okay but this one is going to piss me off otherwise what some hold up okay sorry blink now we're going to do something fun hi Stephanie I'm sorry want to hear what's happening out in the real world no I'd rather forget about Harvest for a while with Fage I got help from chat I got help from chat I think I used a guide once for Fage but I got help that that's for sure I feel so close to you Steve like we're the only two people in Harvest the only two real people do you know what I mean oh I know what you mean um you've been yes I need to feel something again this sense I have that I've known you it's my only link to my past yeah yeah maybe it's different than memory maybe we don't remember each other so much as we recall the feelings deep inside strong feelings maybe the body has its own memory let's find out let's find out I want you make don't [Music] look I want you too then take me now I don't think this is going to be like to [Music] right I'm not sure oh nice Mr posam is looking at us no it's it's okay it's we see a lot of this on Twitch it doesn't matter we're [Music] fine [Music] whoa dmy [Music] Mommy okay that was um yeah necessary um that was not necessary [Music] actually it's exactly two pixels might be two and a half uh we got to just go get have the cloth them Exquisite cloth yes Closs should trigger quite a bit of dissension amongst our Gallant firefighters still that is not your concern your next assignment I remember to the Toral establishment of Mr pastorelli and abscond with his prized barers pole fine of respect for authority a fine trait for a member of the order yes I approve St this is also super weird in your task break into the shop steal the Bara B and bring it back to me at that point I shall give you your final task like I must have I don't remember my first play through that much but I must have used the guide sometimes nobody finishes this game without one you guys hold on look what I have to do here I I so somewhat remember this but I'm going to save um I remember this being a bit weird Barber so I have to use the tape I think on the door you have to like tape the window so that you can use your axe or your wrench I think it was to muffle the sound it is these puzzles They Go the Distance man it's crazy okay um I guess I need to use the wrench again here well that didn't work well that didn't work no [Music] screwdriver oh right okay okay load um there's an alarm [ __ ] um see apparently the tape is all I remember okay now there is that it oh no I need a screwdriver that can't be it yeah that's it okay well we're done boom we're kind of flying through this game we're kind of flying through it and that was kind of the that's what I said like when I put this on the list right we're going to make this a quick one yo what's up Dennis how you doing sir I don't know if I I no I can't finish it tonight but we should be able to finish it on Thursday like if you know what to do in this game it can be really short ah [ __ ] I got to switch discs guys [ __ ] hold look there we go uh right that was wasn't it control shift F4 instead yeah it says control F4 but it's control shift F4 um I think it was yeah three or four but there are some discs are like really short I think cuz [Music] um we're uh actually getting close to the whole Lodge sequence which is going to be a [ __ ] I'm so going to use a guide for most of this guys I'm so using a guide don't know what happened to it I wanted to send it your way ooh that's kind of you I got to pee guys attemp to save everyone oh is that a thing right yeah that was a thing ooh I'll try it's not going to happen we both know that but I'll try hello dear how are you today by the way I spoke with Mr Johnson and he's living seems someone scratched up his Priceless Tucker if he finds out who they'll be heck to pay did you hear what happened at the barber shop someone broke into Pastor salon and took his antique barber pole the next morning pastorelli touched some live wires that the thief left lying around and was electrocuted well that darn Foreigner got what he deserved if you ask me coming into a nice little town like Harvest and stealing business Heavens if a bowl and scissors were good enough for your father I don't see why decent working folk need a fancy [ __ ] styling their hair that's how it goes first you get a [ __ ] trim then Bang You're a communist y that's how it goes I hear those silly firemen broke out the axes and hacked each other to death things never were the same between them after theous robbery oh well maybe now we'll get some real men for the fire department though the way things are going I doubt you'll be around to see it break in and take can't you feel the way the stalks whisper in the Autumn Wind it's almost Harvest Time Steve when the chaff will be cast aside before the feast Right congratulations hero you found Karen after all you don't seem proud mother I wonder why I warned you not to waste time looking for her am I running out of time the blood drive is coming soon what does that have to do with anything if you haven't joined the lodge by then you'll find out still I'm glad you found the poor baby she says Mr potam was responsible for what happened to her well he was what a silly little girl uh I believe her shame on you imagine accusing your future father-in-law of a thing like that he's a [ __ ] creep is that how a range Rider would behave I don't think so why would she lie Skater Boy era wiener even if he is a child molester a kidnapper and an attempted murderer that's no reflection on what kind of father-in-law he'll be I just can't wait for the wedding can you isn't it exciting Steve 5 days and 1200 cookies later the baked sale is already here 12200 cookies how many people live in this town those 1,200 cookies how many are you taking to the sale oh about 20 the rest were sale but the effort wasn't wasted it's Psy CA will you be at the school tonight I uh yeah I wouldn't miss it that's nice dear it's good to be open to new experiences how exactly is this bake sale supposed to benefit hobos and tramps Mr moan over at the wayf farer Hotel can tell you more about that either way I think you should be at the school tonight okay all right right what does moan have to do with this bake sale he was the one who suggested it I thought the lodge was sponsoring it is he a member no but he has ties to the order and he's intimately acquainted with the problem he not only runs the hotel he's also the mortician um hold up let me say good night to someone okay we got to go don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy you know how he right right do you actually have to do that I don't know if you actually have to do that I'll do it though you know just just scaredy might shoot me someday if I don't did I never bring this back not yet okay hey St you just bring back the Bob pole and then um and here it is the I think I remember what the next thing is imported ventian glass and Italian dreams you have done well an unfortunate side effect that pastorelli was electrocuted because you left live wires in a puddle on Flor but as those with affectations of worldliness say say yes that's what they say past R took a big spill permanent one yes a cut down in his prime I see what you did there of course you only wanted the ball but that hardly matters now your final assignment is to set up high in DNA Diner and let the French fry where they may that's no minor prank so close and yet so far what a p tonight the bake sale commences soon the annual harvest blood drive will be at the funniest ad on TV when sacrifice will be the order of the day your time in Harvest grows short I learned about that recently um going I put my dick in there right so we need to set fire to add Mouse wait wasn't it always was there a

proprietor of the Wayward Hotel most people ask me why I don't remember their names well you always were a kider Steve besides as one who deals with the dead I try not to involve myself in the Affairs of the living your loss of memory is of no concern to me true or false ironic considering my recent involvement in a charity event what are you talking about my complaints were Central to the scheduling of the upcoming Harvest bake sale I'm gratified the order of the Harvest Moon got involved the proceeds will certainly help cover my losses I do hope you'll attend the bake sale and spend sure I'll be all they have to do to benefit is die a ditch makes a poor resting place you'll need to learn that if you ever want to leave Harvest you make it sound like I have a choice a choice that is rapidly Vanishing join the lodge while you may I'm on it all right we're not going to talk to all about all the [ __ ] because I say it I need the glue from him but it was so weird cuz there's a

merary guy this game is so weird I forgot how weird this game is like I knew I remember it was weird but game is just next [Music] level um ah you've taken up photography I see now why on Earth would

Astro glue I do suggest you take it or it's all you'll get from me all right a wise decision when a wasp's nest is stirred up it is seldom the Wasps who grieve later okay I think I have to do

supposed to and bums who wander into town who don't have enough money for a decent burial they deserve to be buried it's the Christian thing to do that's awful nice of you but why do so many derix and bums Dy in Harvest don't be such a wise Apple Steve what a good boy why I okay I don't think there is much I can do exit doors are locked oh here ladies someone has just burned down the TV station did it he did it that's the um the post office guy uh TV station station there he is [ __ ] Mr programming was lit oh hell yeah there's nothing I can do here we you look at that oh beautiful that is made those Flames that is amazing all right that leaves um Med the option to also burn down a diner okay save here because I think it's the same uh DNA I think I need a tape again okay oh wow my memory serves me right trying to do as much without a guide as I still remember oh [ __ ] wait come on damn it well that didn't work okay I could turn that on but I need a pan oh it was a cake C well that didn't well that didn't work well that didn't work so this is also weird um you need to use the Cake cover with the glue we just had oh man damn it or other way around apply the glue to the rim of the Cake cover and we can use it to cover the fire alarm see why my playr cost me about 10 plus hours last time this is why now we just turn it on do I need the matches or do I just go well that didn't well that didn't work think I have to yeah yeah okay boom day number 06 so talk to Mom we're going to go till uh the whole LOD part we're going to do that on Thursday and I think this is the last day before that happens hello dear how are you today the nerve of some people burning down the TV station to detract from our fake sale I doubt the perpetrator did it just to annoy the Harvest PTA coincidence I don't think so just 6 months ago the newspaper building went up in smoke obviously there's a firebug on the loose either that or a communist Steve I'm so scared uh why are you scared now that the big sail's over I just don't know how I'll feel my time oh I feel so useless my goodness oh no this is the most [ __ ] up scene in the game my goodness it's not actually but it is nasty pop him right back in oh it's not as bad as it looks you just pop them back in Jesus why see as good as new It's So Random she ate must have had wasp EGS in it don't you think we should get her to a doctor what four she's got her mother how silly I was feeling useless just because there are no more cookies to bake I can still rear my brood this is a sign Steve I have a purpose again glad to see you're feeling better mind that fire still Burns there's a lot of uses for that one news building then DNA's Diner then wh R I sense a pattern and any pattern I can't make a dress out of is no darn good I suppose you heard about DNA's Diner burning down Sheriff Dwayne thinks it was a grease fire we took a black eye on the bake sail but I'm sure the Harvest PTA annual blood drive will be more successful overall we made about 200 hardly enough to bury a dead horse and definitely not enough to cover the annual blood drive it's the 1950s sure you can bury a dead horse for $200 right anual if you knew how much blood we get you'd be more impressed donations are mandatory Steve if you're still here come s until until it hurt hey we we don't use needles expensive as a shovel well it was free for me got one right here somewhere there all right newspaper hey Steve you've been doing a SWR job um I might want to look this up I think I just go to part down talk to my day about Stephanie Maybe yeah I don't remember his part I'm glad to see you I feel so alone cooped up in here I saw the TV station go up from my window lighted up the whole town looked like hell I wished it would consume the whole damn place my phone don't talk like that I'm sorry I just can't stand it anymore I wish there was something I could do there he is make love to me again do it to me now I've done that last [Music] week he's still wearing the same damn [Music] thing it's the same cut scene I'm going to skip it uh um okay um go to Stephanie I'm doing there in a different order but does it matter right okay we have to look at the aftermath or did you say hello Tok now I forgot about this you molested Karen yeah I know what that crazy little [ __ ] said but it's not true I was at home that night Mrs pot damn will B no you weren't isn't that right Mrs pod your pooper was getting fixed that's right Mr podon hello Steve care to stay for some pot roast forget the pot roast mother pot roast isn't for backstabbers for persecutors I won't share my meat with him my meat my [Music] meat okay very the protective about his meat and I think you'd better be going young man before I call your mother and tell on you you know with a Slaughter housee full of meat in town what kind of nutcase would steal a Barber's pole oh well Pastor R won't need it where he is God Rest his soul those silly willies down at the fire station are just incensed about losing some deck the sound in this house is really weird broken maybe they should be more concerned with fire and less with flame Harvest will never be the same without DNA's Diner or without DNA for that matter okay I guess I have to let's look at the aftermath with the TV station high range can you spare a dime for a Buckaroo Who's down on his luck the whole she just went up in flames and I'm looking to mosy on to greener pastures where the sunset's always golden and there's always another Savage to kill all right how about that m i can enter oh [ __ ] oh whoops I forgot about this oh damn [Music] children yeah you know there weren't any rules back in the '90s when it comes to killing kids you know [Music] I remember one scene in this game and we're getting to that on on Thursday that is so messed up it's so gross hold up I don't know what to do I'm going to have a look on the bed wait I have to go to Stephanie again huh no wrong house I'm glad to see you you know the firemen someone stole some fabric from them and they're up in in arms about it I took that another harmless prank yep and how many more harmless pranks will you be pulling however many it takes to get in Stephanie if I have to use them to escape then I will are you using them or are they using you [ __ ] if I know just a bolt of cloth you've turned the firemen against each other they think one of their own stole it would you rather stay here I've heard that Harvest is lovely in the fall when the leaves turn orange and gold and the annual blood dry Paints the town red all right all right I think DOA Cat made a song about this I don't know if you heard or not but Mr pastelli the barber he's dead looks like somebody stole a Barber's Pole from him then left the exposed electrical wires and some water on the floor Pastor Elli walked in flipped on the lights and know anything about that not a thing no Mr swell came by I heard him telling my father about it he said it smelled like roast pork well these things happen yeah wasn't me especially around here I heard that DNA's Diner yeah that wasn't me either why are you looking at me like that did you torch it Steve no no no I would never do that of course not this had the stamp of another Lodge initiation stunt would you know so but I had nothing to do with it thank God for that she hung herself you know and Karen can you imagine killing your own daughter the dis playing a lot of games she must have felt there was no way to carry on after the fire accidents happen it was no accident the sheriff supposedly found evidence that the fire was set a a match are you sure you didn't yeah I did lie to you no I'm sure you wouldn't I feel bad true you found Karen yeah just in time too he'd molested her and buried her alive nor would go back and for after so he just decided sck in the ground and let fate take its course who who would do that to a helpless child she says it was Mr POD stamp and I believe her oh Christ and all this time I've probably ask for the D like two more lines that thing watching me take it easy okay so at least he'll be coming to take him away won't [Music] they okay so what am I do now I'm glad to see you come if it isn't my favorite s pick up the invitation on the bed what bed wait I just have to go to I mean I I did my time and I went out DNA Diner is no yes she hung herself as soon as she realized what haded to her beloved establishment poor woman a true entrepreneur and a credit to our nation I know you should do that anyone who spoke with her for five minutes would have known what a tragedy the destruction Diner would be still you sought to torch her Diner and torch titties you have proven yourself a worthy candidate for initiation this was only a trial to DET ini worthiness for testing your initiation into the mysteries of the Harvest will soon begin in the meantime be patient protocols must be observed how I recognize the sign you will know when you receive the invitation bring it here and your initiation shall begin [ __ ] yeah oh sorry okay we got to wait wait for that on my house let me safe somewhere in D6 [Music] initiation the matter is speckled with odd stains it now cuz I still i i i vividly remember the last thing I have to do and that's when the game gets really really hard and [ __ ] honestly um go Stephanie again yeah uhoh Mr pot down guess I could forget about the meat huh what do you mean your dad must have pulled some strings be sure and check Stephanie's pillow you lucky mad that I got into hell are you talking about a l you'll see once the sheriff gets here Stephanie Stephanie things will never be the same now guess I'll be watching TV nights okay you can come in now son oh yeah right my God is that what I think it is yep it's a spinal cord is it Stephanie I can see a resemblance but I can't be sure more pie Sheriff pie don't you realize what what happened oh indeed I do I can just hear the tongues waging at the PTA this game was it suicide never heard of anyone pulling their own spinal cord out before off the Record I'd have to say no no all in all I'd say this was death by natural causes natural causes natural causes you can't live without a spinal cord son nothing unnatural about that think a will have some more power right away I can't believe this this is horrible believe me you get to the point to where this is routine yeah does it happen a lot now the only clue we got is that card on our pillow take a look at it he is known that the sacred order of the harest Moon hereby member Steve Mas confession confession to us huh murder isn't that what you're here to investigate son you don't investigate natural deaths no point then I'll get to the bottom of this myself yeah I'm sure you will F Stephanie more pie Sheriff don't mind if I do it's such nightmare fuel all right let's take that invitation okay can't allow you to take a remains boy I think I need that eventually are you [Music] anyway I think I need that but if I bring the invitation to uh he's just chilling on the couch he's like ah well just another day right does he have anything to say I'm so hungry Steve so hungry if I'd been an astronaut I could afford all the meat I want the red kind and the young she gave it to her a day before my meat I did um watch you received the invitation but you have not brought it yeah see I need the spinal cord the invitation was not the card but the spinal cord it must be presented to me air I allow you to enter what have you done with step the Mysteries are only disclosed to members of the order not initiates well damn it you were provided an invitation bring me the skull and spinal cord if you would pass to the world be okay um no not Johnson's residence oh wait I'm stupid it's not de here anymore right nope I know where it is okay so we do want to save here trust me let's go there and let's save we so I think it's in the crypts somewhere here yeah yeah yeah yeah I remember okay so um save rips and then we have the ladder um okay let's save here actually uh let's wear the axe as a [Music] weapon I got absolutely [ __ ] for no reason I'm fine but I could do that better I think you really want to pay attention to health I'm going to need it this is where the game gets really really tough [ __ ] all right this wasn't too bad look I think my health is just completely fine now so that's that's a lot better there we go that's mine now game is so weird did I mention that already all right now we go to the lodge not the post office ah you have done well now let the initiation commence as your myog it is requested and required that I turn over this sacred dagger to you to D in your quest what is this you must now enter the lodge initiates find it a hostile place are you supposed to help me or get me killed I'm starting you on the path of initiation to a very special very exclusive Brotherhood I am merely the administrator of a test whether you view me as an eny or a friend depends on how well you're prepared to pass this thing you haven't said what it is it is a special weapon using it will be part of the initiation okay um you always have a choice initiate which choices you make matter only to you whatever occurs in here is relevant to the great question which you the great question but answer the meaning of life what is at issue is whether in answering the question you will find the answers you seek you will encounter those intent on preventing or prompting your answer depending on how you look at it w the assumption is you want to live dying is easy and provides its own answer but not for you just tell me is Stephanie dead or being held within the membership director on the second level keeps track of such things oh great then you are against me I am the Sergeant at Arms I am here to ensure that the protocols are observed deviation from a protocol shall result in punishment remember what I have told you now let the initiation begin okay next disc all right I'm going to save here we're going to save this last part of the game for Thursday uh D Lodge time yeah time to go to bed for me I'm sleepy start recording let's play some Harvester whoa hold up boom is it capturing yes it is uh I will be going to twitchcon Yes um I didn't really go there for twitchcon because I was going to go for When We Were Young festival and it just so happened to be that twitchcon is in the same weekend so I'll be at twitch G too right uh control shift F4 I think there we go control shift4 thank you mcaro I think I will I'll be fine all right this is where we yeah we're in the lodge excellent you'll find them through that door little guy from The Barber you are the Exterminator are you not no in that case I'm afraid you'll have a hard time of it sir recently the lodge has become Infested by pests they need Exterminating or to be blunt sir they need killing and plenty so hard to hear going to get some food I'm hungry I just had dinner and after dinner I completely murdered this Pringle SC so I am I can say I am I'm full enjoy the food um what's the quickest way to the second level the second floor sir the entrance is hidden but a little reflection should reveal the answer to find the key to the second Flor floor reach deep within yourself am I in my anus good luck sir I only hope you can stomach what's ahead stomach what's ahead bust beov and glares down okay the there it wasn't it just on the floor [Music] here a [ __ ] display light okay [Music] look where do I go I don't remember this you are oh come on what kind of P are we talking about speaking of cockroaches a bewildering variety of deadly beasts lie Beyond I wish you good luck sir am I blind is it just [Music] oh uh-oh is the forbidden slide look look okay um right yes this looks normal um that is definitely what I think it is uh anyway yo what's up canoli how's your butthole I mean how how you doing oh my God I mean if yours does that might want to see a doctor oh wait I don't want to go there yet do I have the blade already I do have to Blade oh completely missed that uh all right so this sucks there's going to be so many enemies it's going to be so tough guys uh let me just start um Lodge start when the ghost pepper chicken sandwich I had last night came back to bite me so this is what happened yeah yeah I can imagine soaking in a puddle of bile okay don't don't eat that mushroom yeah this game is going to get rough I remember now Tor grow is erupting from his fleshy prison that's a hemorrhoid I'm the blue eye I'm in the big eye boom upon leaving the strange rooms behind you notice a burning feeling on your pooper uh you notice a gooey Film SL of slime covers your clothes oh [ __ ] uh not yet I do need to wash my clothes I remember this oh look H must have disagreed with something that ate them yes oh [ __ ] okay hold up we are so going to fly through this um what did I have to do I'm going to check this real quick right right right right right right I remember being stuck here for a while yes yes got to kill him right oh oh [ __ ] I'm so dead you're all are again dick what is up my [Music] dude can he drop anything did [Music] Barky okay I think what I have to to do all right this was weird too okay let's go back because we need new clothes El we die no not you think here this is a cloak room sir by definition not a Fitting Place to seek answers however it's plain that the acid from your your deal is eating away at your clothing and skin yeah okay we give him the $5 not 200 Pi your money to clo room intenna cleans the acid of your clothes well thank [Music] you oh I'm not allowed to touch anything okay uh let's save [Music] again clean [Music] boy um okay so what we have to do here is actually do this you acquire a [Laughter] shotgun the death the Tropic of rivalry this Togo Whispers good times of past okay um what was this a again yeah see this game is so weird man like how the [ __ ] am I G to find that out so weird got some shotgun sh oh there it is okay nice now that is going to help um can't go there right [Music] no no let's go to the kitchen like it's been fun going through this game again I hope you're proud of yourself killing my clientele ever since the monsters invaded this level the members have taken to dining with the Grand Puba upstairs actually I have to admit my last few meals haven't been up to snow the problem is the freshness of the corpses or lack thereof see the supply has dried up the sergeant-at-arms always used to insisted bodies killed in the lodge be disposed of without trays and so the members would bring me their business for preparation and dissemination what the [ __ ] anyway so what I was trying to say is we're going to keep the replays of video games to a minimum because this game is the best if you play it the first time because you will go everywhere and be lost and that is something you don't want to do again like second time you I just noticed I just really wanted to fly through this so I looked uh looked up a lot stuff eating people now yeah we went from cats to people do you know about a girl name Stephanie you need to talk to the membership director up on too can you tell me anything that might help me not really I think we can pick this up Burger uh Burger hand there's a head in there nice nice what is my health doing by the way oh yeah we want to eat that oh and I he happy again would you look at that what if I miss since you killed the was BL basically the whole [Laughter] game that's like the the first thing we did yeah we we're at the last part of the game we are into the lodge now we're going to finish up here and we should be uh done with the game in about an hour I remember you having sex a lot yeah me too those were the years man I it's like yeah I think that's like almost 10 years ago now oh in the game you mean in the game right yes yeah that was also the beginning um let me see what the [ __ ] I have to do now yo what's up P Jeffy there should be a light switch here in the cloak room oh what the [ __ ] I would have never found that oh [Music] God so I remember doing this with the harest blade and it's a [ __ ] so there's this cult thingy the lodge where you apply for that that that's the permise of the game basically that's the plot and you have to do some tasks like scratching a car and burning down a diner and now then now I'm in now I'm in the lodge that's basically what happened not that I would know because I'm a man of God I'm saving myself for to one yes same same can we use um2 200 on slot machines I'm going to do that in two weeks so damn okay didn't I pick up one of the balls here wasn't that thing maybe not but I can pick up this no I can't I can pick up this no I can't I can yeah see I can pick that up I knew that you eat the gumball and feel better nice I don't know what the thing was I just uh [ __ ] offed by the way that came straight straight of [Music] alen right right yes right we're dead I remember this I remember this um this this is exactly why we had to go to the kitchen [Music] go my flush out of order and flush sick I remember [ __ ] definitely something in [Music] there oh here we go that's what we need the weed killer we need weed um okay let's hope I'm not missing anything here because I have two body parts and this is the last one I'm pretty sure all I have to [Music] do as go here in there and use the weed killer on plant sck [Applause] safe weat killed do a dealership fan Comm call back today oh really nice good job salmon hole put penis in hole all basically a checkup for a car I don't know what it is in English oh that is so [Applause] scary must be something here or maybe not surface I guess it's surface I don't know I don't own a [Applause] car there's nothing here to use something don't have anything let me check uh okay have to open the fountain pick up the key in the fountain it's pretty hard to spot near your right shoulder Jesus Christ I was about to leave see this is why we're using a guide for this one okay maybe maybe we need to make the rule that after this game we're Banning guides okay okay then I can have help from chat if it's really bad but I we have to ban guides maybe that's what we have to do but this game is a 20h hour game and I already played it if you're not using a guide cuz you're just stuck all the time really hoping on a newer kind of game after this one by the way oh [ __ ] Aries oh my god oh yeah I'm almost dead can I heal somewhere here [Music] because okay I am going to save but I'm going to call it like almost almost [Music] [Music] [Music] dead all right we're here yeah true true sorry maybe maybe we do that but I have to ask my mom's permission to use a guide first there's a home to the Harvest Moon Art Gallery sir I'm the curator of this place so delighted you could come I expect it'll be an engaging experience that it will I'm afraid art often forces engagement doesn't it lovely Works pastoral scenes Noble sculptures these are easy on the eye and mind but when confronted with a work of hideous form you're forced to deal with it even if only to dismiss it as trash sadly hardest to dismiss protes and it works of beauty are necessary that should be taken for granted nevertheless it's important that each individual determine his own sense of Aesthetics for that reason I give you permission to obliterate that which forces you to linger too long in the all right man I'm just passing through yeah this is going to suck by the way because we are so close to D Ling and I think we need to kill some [ __ ] around here yeah these [ __ ] all right okay okay we got to do this differently because uh let's load let's load weed killed brought the [Music] key and we might want to shoot that [ __ ] damn it because uh he's tough there now I only got hit once I think we're we're doing a lot better he hits hard but okay uh save game not almost dead it it's there's so many enemies and it's going to suck so bad guys going to suck so bad kill all of them I think [Music] boink oh man how does one heal all right all right wait one of them should maybe I already have it yeah I got it hard Gallery key enemies stay that yeah they do thankfully thankfully oh god um okay is that it no [ __ ] how do I get back to or back how do I get to the place I have to be which I think is the chest part all right whatever I'll read um one of them should Dro oh I did get the key I'm stupid um I think it's this door no we'll do that can I help you I'm looking for a girl this is a library not a brothel oh sorry you don't understand I have reason hope to believe that she was brought here do you know anything about that I'm afraid not I tend to stay out of Lodge Affairs I'm only in charge of the library my good fellow well if she is here she's not been invited as a member there are no female members of the order to be sure one or two have qualified throughout our history but they're generally not of our caliber I doubt there are any females in this building at least none that are extant but you're a woman I'm not a member women are kept here for the services they are able to render just as some jobs are beneath men so too can certain Services only be supplied by women if she is here you'll find her on the third floor which you'll have difficulty finding without my help and you want something in return I'll give you a clue as to how to get to the third floor but only if you'll retrieve an overdue book from one of our charter members a Mr Caine since he is is so highly regarded among the order I'm loathed to approach him on such an embarrassing matter therefore bring me the book and I'll help you how will I know which book oh you'll know it he's not an Avid Reader okay well for now I [Music] need is not it yeah this is it um I'm dead pretty soon I think hi am the Chess Master this is Harvester the weirdest game made in the '90s it's it's strange man I offer my opponents a choice no just I'm so [ __ ] dead um [ __ ] thought it's Horror oh it's horror trust me okay I got to not get hit yeah hold up let me redo all of it because once you get hit it's over for you this is how you how people soft lock themselves in this game it's it's bad um so we'll go all the way back to weed kill yeah this game is it's old it's it's but it's funny as hell it is so [Applause] funny we're going to be finishing it today though and then we'll we'll go to the next game [ __ ] I wasn't paying attention this game is so [ __ ] rough I I remember you just don't get healing anymore I think it's it's so weird we're going to have to shoot him now him and the janitor I think okay we didn't get hit that's good we still oh we got hit before we got hit before now can I okay move I didn't mean to do that but it doesn't matter we don't need him see that always [ __ ] hits you it's this game sucks man this part is so rough is that the key come on I'm [ __ ] all right dude how the [ __ ] am I going to do this I don't remember how I act actually did that ever okay let's see if I can find some healing somewhere I need it well I could but I'm going to need that shotgun I think it's really no heals I mean I'm probably just going to shotgun the chest [Music] past got about him does he ever die or was this just someone that doesn't die okay he does found a book help need heal suck so bad see if I can do this not playing the chest [ __ ] that okay there we go there we go I don't know how that works you kill a chest piece and he dies but whatever uh he has a key I think in his brain which makes sense right [Music] I'm not going to find any heals um right [Music] nice one [Music] there he is excuse me you can't come in right now I just you think just all right all right he has a [ __ ] me gun okay okay we yeah that's why we had to shoot him I was like can we kill the janitor with no no we need the shotgun for him excuse me all right I wasted one bullet I [Music] think God I'm so so so close to dying I do have a nail gun too [Music] now oh [ __ ] okay help this going to suck because let me show you what's in [Music] here oh that wasn't too bad grabbing the chainsaw you added to your inventory hoping will come in handy well [ __ ] hope so a Cy doll uh something looks like a key well there was a clown

mean you don't know the half of it it is so weird start children are parasites that's what you've got to understand sucking the life out of you your very life's blood pumping from your belly through obscene pink tubes into their thieving hearts and even after birth they keep leeching the life from you Mommy you're so good M yummy it it sounds like one of the Tik Tok NPCs oh yummy you're are good my children are better at it than most is that the Bliss of motherhood that's the mystery just what the world needs more greedy little Ms to feed yes children suck the life out of society they have to

Mercy ano is this voice it's God's voice and where do he dwell the Lord the Lord in heaven indeed any other response would be Blasphemous answer me this if word be with you does the Lord bounce on the spring or Frolic with the Wombats definitely froling with the Wombats yes the field no bouncing on a string before marriage wombats and he is their Shepherd yes answer thus if thou be virtuous do God Almighty heard them with his staff special imported wombat hurting equipment staff right naturally yes God being Almighty hath no need to import anything his staff doth serve now I ask thee one final question which is only known to those amongst the ranks of the the same the is God a jar of strawberry preserves a size 12 snaker a foot long hogy an all expense paid trip to Brazil yeah just

nerves sing alike yet the results differ the question can only be answered by Paradox although the body functions according to the tenets of science the invocation of pain is an art my implements are simple things like a painter's brushes from which beautiful complexities spring different stories brought forth from different canvases with the different application of a stroke oh yeah I invite you

brother Stephanie I believe you have something for her cigarettes ring the bell and win a prize for the lovely lady or is it win the lovely lady as your prize enough Gaines agreed there she is each time you climbed the Rope you caused her pain but you always hurt the ones you love sorry stuff sorry is that all you require I want an explanation of course you do there are no such things as monsters and yet you've killed monsters everything in the Harvest is just slightly Esq this is because as advanced as our technology is we cannot make the Sim any better than this the subject's subconscious always warps it in unpredictable ways yes diddies Sam this is nothing more reality designed by the Harvesters to test potential members having successfully completed the program you have earned the right to become a harvester a harvester what the hell is a harvester the hand that grips the knife that stabs the on who move amid the crop and harvest the fruit you're talking about people killing people yep we're going to become the Harvester that's the ending we're choosing and again I believe the technical term is serial killer the Harvesters seek to perpetuate ter and Discord for our own purposes we do this the Harvester logo as a tattoo of murder and we I don't know about that one through our recruitment of initiates like yourself you want me to become a serial killer this enre entire reality has been engineered to break down your resistance to desensitize you to violence TST now you may become a harvester and reenter the real world or stay in peace with young Stephanie and spend the rest of your life in the construct known as harvest what is the real world world at this point right now you are suspended in a sensory deprivation tank wild to a VR deck if you don't join us VR in the90s your life support and you will be dead within minutes those last minutes however will seem like a lifetime livt in Harvest you will marry Stephanie and die peacefully of old age what do we want to choose presuming a while now we're going to become a killer killer serial killer she is the only real person the only good ending harest suspended in a tank jacked in just as you are Jack jacked off you want to spend time did you choose last time last time we did both I showed both we can do that again of course all we have to do is kill the guy again completed your ordeal you may leave with her then we can skip this and just go for the other ending your Victory we can do both if on the other hand you wish to join us the cost of exiting the lodge is the same as the cost of entering the lodge a skull and spinal cord 3 hours later can you move it along I'm all out of time cards no no you couldn't kill me these Harvesters they put people through this torture to give them a taste for killing the way to beat them is to deny them why are you new like what's the deal why do you not have clothes on you're thinking about killing me aren't you didn't you hear what he said I do exist if you kill me here I'll die for real and I'll feel all the pain all the terror because I'm real well after all what's a murder without pain and Terror col is a heresy's a lovely brunette impulses directly into her brain and then pull the plug you will be a murderer this time for real so what will it be life in Harvest or Life as a harvest choose now how about both how about both let's start with can I just save here yeah dude we can just save here perfect uh game 21 and ending okay let's start with uh Mary Stephanie so we'll stay in the town in the virtual reality town with

enjoy the life you've chosen such as it [Music] is I like how he's marrying [Music] us [Music] and [Music] that this is the real [Music] world what a waste this kid could have been something never looked back we got two more to plug in there's got right back in serial killers this this is scientific you want we should go back to the old way what old way good breeding that's ending one and the rest of the game look it's not the good ending because it says game over I think I don't know um ending and now we choose to be a harvester so basically this this place was here to create a killer out of us please help me so now we have to kill Stephanie I'm so sorry this is I'm so sorry like they really want to make you feel [Music] it oh this is yeah fatality I remember this beautiful wow that

tune basically everyone who puts this game on YouTube gets demonetized apparently because the Harvester tune sounds a lot like Joe cockers leave your hat on playing Harvester I don't think I have it but I read it on Twitter once the very thought breeding serial killers it's disgusting it's cool you'll rot your mind playing games like that don't you know people who watch violence become violent

start seeing Vernick fairy tales it was never directly exposed to the engine never even made it below level one in the building would be an enormous breach of protocol if security of doctors were speaking of the wall Rider within hearing of a contracted security guard seems vanly improbable that he would stumble onto such an obscure mythological story on his own too similar to the Dr saml case or the others before him it's one thing for formerly Sean medical personnel to fall under the delusions of their patients it's another thing entirely for those believes to be I don't know airborn we need to talk in person feelings Kink kink okay well that's great oh here dink dink this is where I just came from [ __ ] Gober no is it let me see that M or oh my God it is about gos yeah okay nothing

inhuman [ __ ] GRE driven moral genocide the moral the monsters mov ripped from tortured Minds the lengths the Jack booted business school worms will go to protect it their own man slaughtered I've never prayed in my life Lisa but if some small-minded intervention God is listening kill Jeremy Blair before I die sanity and effus no pain he doesn't deserve there's no radio no hope of reaching the outside world only Escape all right here we go here no more sickness no more get out of my blood you [ __ ] [ __ ] you fuckie of sh come here no no nightm Rick one hitting the greens last week we should make the drive more often I was reviewing some old test records from the early days of project wall Rider and something sparked my interest were you following the project back in 2010 apparently we had issues with female employees experiencing psychomatic pregnancies something to do with the morphogenic engine interacts with the immune system All Greek To Me am all right it was more often fatal than not and these employees and not patients so a little harder to sweep under the rug but the morphogenic engine activity in these ladies marrow was off the chart charts uh and these women who are never even exposed to additional hormone therapy now I know PPM from a kick in the teeth but I can read a spreadsheet and if the projected profits from Pro wall Rider are half of what they say they are I just got one question why aren't we performing experiments on women God knows mental illness is an equal opportunity Affliction some seems unee difficult to pass up on such potential windfall sincerely Jare yeah guys I'm also going to go um because uh I got to get up for a haircut tomorrow so I got to sleep at a reasonable time and I'm pretty tired so I'm going to make use of that we'll continue this once I'm back from Vegas boom it's been two and a half weeks or three two and a half I think we just checked two and a half well we're back oh wow I think I actually remember the last thing we did because there was a file here and I think that's the last thing we did let's read that file let me see if I can still play video games oh God one of them's coming it's not even human anymore talking about me block it shut it in I'm not human anymore 5 hours for St is probably never saw a blade of GRA I guess so uh I forgot literally all controls guys did we have a camera we did right yes okay the only game I played the last two days because I haven't gamed in a while was um Spider-Man Miles Morales let me add that by the way St um condemned you guys are confused about this then let me explain this is our wheel of horror games uh our goal is to finish 100 horror games and after every game or a series of games like Outlast is going to be the series so we're going to play two after this but after every game or series we spin this wheel and it will decide what game is next now with Channel points you can like make some games a bit bigger on here I'm really struggling to find there we go um so they have a increased chance that it get gets picked the next time um a lot of people really want to see condemned it's somehow get gets dodged every [ __ ] time like the other big game was Michigan I think and we we played that already but that was like five games ago how do I yes okay cool cool I I remember how to game we're good what's this you know what I did yesterday guys I bought one of those Ultra Premium me Pokemon card boxes for €40 and I only got like one good card out of it he's big I'm out so that made me um sad so I bought two more I have a problem guys like I was so smart with the gambling in Vegas I was I nailed it I didn't gamble much I didn't drink much I didn't do well I did do some crazy [ __ ] but like not not too crazy and then I come back home with extra cash because I was really smart about everything and I just wasted all on Pokemon cards Jesus quit smoking barely drinking anymore now it's Pokemon oh come on that was open that was open you could just see it open what how does this waste it no no I brought back 800 bucks from Vegas I would never waste that I would invest best that in Pokemon didn't even open them on stream for I was going to but then I I was at a concert yesterday and I came home and that box was just staring at me like you have mu right on the front and it's like staring at me like you could hear it whisper a little bit um open me in Pokemon language I think that's just English or Japanese yeah it was definitely Japanese um so I I'm sorry wait I couldn't wait it it wasn't special though there were like two hits in it I think I got a zap dos which is a $40 cart so it's not it's not too bad it's the sound of your bank balance pling oh right I thought it was Japanese all right yeah you yeah whoops I guess uh J kill us burn the building worse than death here kill us um okay okay this is the sound is a bit low I think let me Crank that up and they're playing Lords of the Fallen I have been uh every time I open like Discord it says Argan playing Lords of the fallen so I've been trying I've been stopping myself from getting it because there's literally not a single Souls like in the world that I ever really enjoyed okay n never mind I was going to say I enjoyed armored Core but that's not a Souls like that is literally a from software game so on why are you are these guys always masturbating blood will out there are always strains always wounds is it this game is so messed up come on come on come D some some things are just so [ __ ] up that you can't stop watching it you know maybe that's just me uh what the [ __ ] the [ __ ] is that you okay need help masturbating on the corpses it's [ __ ] up it depends like if it's still warm never mind it is your pumpkin hat yeah I saw that nice I um I got my new capture card and it works like a charm so I've been um playing Miles Morales because I still got to play that and I bought Spider-Man 2 from a colleague which I left at work I just realized so I got that for off stream and then on two weeks uh RuneScape is starting leaks so I'll be playing that a lot um to be honest I kind of want to stream a bit of that too so it might do like two days of the horror 100 and one day of chill and run escape I don't know uh which button was that power is still on electricity I think I need to think Lisa I thought the power was evidence that some manable some human Force still controllable some part still controlled some part of Mount massive but nothing human or sing can do anything here but survive even not for long you were always the reasonable one Lisa you would tell me to calm down to take larger fuel Madness and inhumanity rule this place whatever is keeping the electricity flowing is trying to trap me here I need to shut it down again yes that's basically that game yeah that is uh exactly that game so every well it's not every year because the last Leakes was quite a while ago I think but it's like a special Tim limited game mode it it runs for like two 3 months and you have more XP and you kind of choose what areas you want to unlock and a lot of fun extras and I love that game mode I [ __ ] love it okay oh oh oh oh oh oh oh my god did you wash your hands excuse me Inn Explorer 6 no no you they actually have a launcher now holy [ __ ] oh my God I need I haven't been jump scared in two weeks

I needed a key I just can't remember for what man Eddie gluskin um lucid dreaming figures remain as murky as ever gluskin claims near constant control of his dream state yet correspondence between his narrative and RM Cycles highly arithmetic RM and nrm morphogenic engine activity plateus at 19 penis per minutes um Diagnostics heavy bron bron heavy bronchial accumulation the rashes associated with hormone therapy have proceeded and vanished since we stopped using latex tub Ling remains frustrating interview subject he's still trying to tell us what he thinks he wants to hear uh while studiously avoiding certain elements of the truth his childhood remains an obvious fiction might sight is all blurry and I don't know why I think it's just because I'm tired so I'm like reading word for word it's it's weird uh childhood remains an obvious fiction he claim seeming to have grown up in Leave it to Beaver okay despite a traumatically violent my game just allab okay uh where was I um despite a traumatically violent ongoing sexual experience that is a matter of public and medical record when I confronted him with the photographs his father and uncle took he responded with a mixture of laughter and anger and for strains for issued he similarly refuses to discuss his victims he both orally and specifically when I showed him pictures of the women he would not admit that they were dead or mutilated his claiming advancement in the morphogenic engine program that he has not yet achieved said that he could clearly hear the voice of the wall Rider just by closing his eyes clearly is trying to c a favor of his of his doctors won't speculate at what he expects to gain by it so I guess the guy following me is Mr Eddie gluskin he's um had quite the past and completely lost it and now mutilates women but apparently also thinks everyone is women I think this is dead end do backflip no let's not um where do I go I should have stuck with let's not I said it let's not but just for science I guess you know you never know in horror games like in Silent Hill they just want you to jump down everything you see and then in another horror game you die if you jump down down I mean how how can I [Music] know he in here somewhere do I have to pick up the paper again oh C down no I don't have to is this really a dead end it could just be for the file oh that the the broken lag is so annoying so bad typical Russian Sports Hall School yeah looks like a Dutch one too just looks like a school sports Hall like a gymnasium I never went there but I've been there like once or twice and

through verx files and found no mention of the three lucid dream dreamers I think we could safely assume wernick was sufficiently distracted by the partial success of patient Billy hope along with

disorder security guard all the way up in at block is our latest non-patient employee to start seeing Vernick fairy tales it was never directly exposed to the engine never even made it below level one in the building would be an enormous breach of protocol if security of doctors were speaking of the wall Rider within hearing of a contracted security guard seems vanly improbable that he would stumble onto such an obscure mythological story on his own too similar to the Dr saml case or the others before him it's one thing for formerly Sean medical personnel to fall under the delusions of their patients it's another thing entirely for those believes to be I don't know airborn we need to talk in person feelings Kink kink okay well that's great oh here dink dink this is where I just came

in the wall talking about God tells me not to be afraid how was I ever part of this inhuman [ __ ] GRE driven moral genocide the moral the monsters mov ripped from tortured Minds the lengths the Jack booted business school worms will go to protect it their own man slaughtered I've never prayed in my life Lisa but if some small-minded intervention God is listening kill Jeremy Blair before I die sanity and effus no pain he doesn't deserve there's no radio no hope of reaching the outside world only Escape all right here we go here no more sickness no more get out of my blood you [ __ ] [ __ ] you fuckie of sh come here no no nightm Rick one hitting the greens last week we should make the drive more often I was reviewing some old test records from the early days of project wall Rider and something sparked my interest were you following the project back in 2010 apparently we had issues with female employees experiencing psychomatic pregnancies something to do with the morphogenic engine interacts with the immune system All Greek To Me am all right it was more often fatal than not and these employees and not patients so a little harder to sweep under the rug but the morphogenic engine activity in these ladies marrow was off the chart charts uh and these women who are never even exposed to additional hormone therapy now I know PPM from a kick in the teeth but I can read a spreadsheet and if the projected profits from Pro wall Rider are half of what they say they are I just got one question why aren't we performing experiments on women God knows mental illness is an equal opportunity Affliction some seems unee difficult to pass up on such potential windfall sincerely Jare yeah guys I'm also going to go um because uh I got to get up for a haircut tomorrow so I got to sleep at a reasonable time and I'm pretty tired so I'm going to make use of that we'll continue this once I'm back from Vegas boom it's been two and a half weeks or three two and a half I think we just checked two and a half well we're back oh wow I think I actually remember the last thing we did because there was a file here and I think that's the last thing we did let's read that file let me see if I can still play video games oh God one of them's coming it's not even human anymore talking about me block it shut it in I'm not human anymore 5 hours for St is probably never saw a blade of GRA I guess so uh I forgot literally all controls guys did we have a camera we did right yes okay the only game I played the last two days because I haven't gamed in a while was um Spider-Man Miles Morales let me add that by the way St um condemned you guys are confused about this then let me explain this is our wheel of horror games uh our goal is to finish 100 horror games and after every game or a series of games like Outlast is going to be the series so we're going to play two after this but after every game or series we spin this wheel and it will decide what game is next now with Channel points you can like make some games a bit bigger on here I'm really struggling to find there we go um so they have a increased chance that it get gets picked the next time um a lot of people really want to see condemned it's somehow get gets dodged every [ __ ] time like the other big game was Michigan I think and we we played that already but that was like five games ago how do I yes okay cool cool I I remember how to game we're good what's this you know what I did yesterday guys I bought one of those Ultra Premium me Pokemon card boxes for €40 and I only got like one good card out of it he's big I'm out so that made me um sad so I bought two more I have a problem guys like I was so smart with the gambling in Vegas I was I nailed it I didn't gamble much I didn't drink much I didn't do well I did do some crazy [ __ ] but like not not too crazy and then I come back home with extra cash because I was really smart about everything and I just wasted all on Pokemon cards Jesus quit smoking barely drinking anymore now it's Pokemon oh come on that was open that was open you could just see it open what how does this waste it no no I brought back 800 bucks from Vegas I would never waste that I would invest best that in Pokemon didn't even open them on stream for I was going to but then I I was at a concert yesterday and I came home and that box was just staring at me like you have mu right on the front and it's like staring at me like you could hear it whisper a little bit um open me in Pokemon language I think that's just English or Japanese yeah it was definitely Japanese um so I I'm sorry wait I couldn't wait it it wasn't special though there were like two hits in it I think I got a zap dos which is a $40 cart so it's not it's not too bad it's the sound of your bank balance pling oh right I thought it was Japanese all right yeah you yeah whoops I guess uh J kill us burn the building worse than death here kill us um okay okay this is the sound is a bit low I think let me Crank that up and they're playing Lords of the Fallen I have been uh every time I open like Discord it says Argan playing Lords of the fallen so I've been trying I've been stopping myself from getting it because there's literally not a single Souls like in the world that I ever really enjoyed okay n never mind I was going to say I enjoyed armored Core but that's not a Souls like that is literally a from software game so on why are you are these guys always masturbating blood will out there are always strains always wounds is it this game is so messed up come on come on come D some some things are just so [ __ ] up that you can't stop watching it you know maybe that's just me uh what the [ __ ] the [ __ ] is that you okay need help masturbating on the corpses it's [ __ ] up it depends like if it's still warm never mind it is your pumpkin hat yeah I saw that nice I um I got my new capture card and it works like a charm so I've been um playing Miles Morales because I still got to play that and I bought Spider-Man 2 from a colleague which I left at work I just realized so I got that for off stream and then on two weeks uh RuneScape is starting leaks so I'll be playing that a lot um to be honest I kind of want to stream a bit of that too so it might do like two days of the horror 100 and one day of chill and run escape I don't know uh which button was that power is still on electricity I think I need to think Lisa I thought the power was evidence that some manable some human Force still controllable some part still controlled some part of Mount massive but nothing human or sing can do anything here but survive even not for long you were always the reasonable one Lisa you would tell me to calm down to take larger fuel Madness and inhumanity rule this place whatever is keeping the electricity flowing is trying to trap me here I need to shut it down again yes that's basically that game yeah that is uh exactly that game so every well it's not every year because the last Leakes was quite a while ago I think but it's like a special Tim limited game mode it it runs for like two 3 months and you have more XP and you kind of choose what areas you want to unlock and a lot of fun extras and I love that game mode I [ __ ] love it okay oh oh oh oh oh oh oh my god did you wash your hands excuse me Inn Explorer 6 no no you they actually have a launcher now holy [ __ ] oh my God I need I haven't been jump scared in two weeks forgot how that physically hurts sometimes attacked by a master Bor strangis turkey neck over you don't have to make it sound so [Music] sexy you know Americans have AMC and that's like the best Channel ever whenever I came back from whatever the [ __ ] I was doing in Vegas I would go to my hotel my hotel had a Wing Stop I would get Wing Stop with the spicy [ __ ] on it go to my room turn on my TV and AMC had horror movies every night because you know October so I had chicken a huge [ __ ] bed for myself usually a buzz from all the alcohol and horror movies it was great it was a great ending to every day like I I watched pumpkin head I watched I think saw again for the 600 time I watched House of Wax there so so so many good movies man watch blly now that's a good one how you like it I still got to watch the last episode of Usher keep on forgetting that I have to watch the last episode where the [ __ ] do I go stuck where do I [Music] go this is this where I came from it is so I go this way yes who my God that really got me um would be so easy I don't believe in it anymore getting the truth out there is no truth only lies we've accepted too long to double back on it's our children Lisa I would take the easy way out if it wasn't for the boys damn this place to hell i'll suff anything to get out of

around 10000 p.m. Dutch time um I didn't really leave my bed all weekend I pretty sure I slept for like 30 hours it was crazy um but also not the best idea I ever had because that way my jet lag

okay did you like the main game I absolutely loved it it is one of the best games I played so far uh during this whole horror marathon thing we're doing find the key to access the mill Ward but

out of me you don't calm down couple goals exactly uh calm down with the doors look I I know I needed a key I just can't remember for what man Eddie gluskin um lucid dreaming figures remain as murky as ever gluskin claims near constant control of his dream state yet correspondence between his narrative and RM Cycles highly arithmetic RM and nrm morphogenic engine activity plateus at 19 penis per minutes um Diagnostics heavy bron bron heavy bronchial accumulation the rashes associated with hormone therapy have proceeded and vanished since we stopped using latex tub Ling remains frustrating interview subject he's still trying to tell us what he thinks he wants to hear uh while studiously avoiding certain elements of the truth his childhood remains an obvious fiction might sight is all blurry and I don't know why I think it's just because I'm tired so I'm like reading word for word it's it's weird uh childhood remains an obvious fiction he claim seeming to have grown up in Leave it to Beaver okay despite a traumatically violent my game just allab okay uh where was I um despite a traumatically violent ongoing sexual experience that is a matter of public and medical record when I confronted him with the photographs his father and uncle took he responded with a mixture of laughter and anger and for strains for issued he similarly refuses to discuss his victims he both orally and specifically when I showed him pictures of the women he would not admit that they were dead or mutilated his claiming advancement in the morphogenic engine program that he has not yet achieved said that he could clearly hear the voice of the wall Rider just by closing his eyes clearly is trying to c a favor of his of his doctors won't speculate at what he expects to gain by it so I guess the guy following me is Mr Eddie gluskin he's um had quite the past and completely lost it and now mutilates women but apparently also thinks everyone is women I think this is dead end do backflip no let's not um where do I go I should have stuck with let's not I said it let's not but just for science I guess you know you never know in horror games like in Silent Hill they just want you to jump down everything you see and then in another horror game you die if you jump down down I mean how how can I [Music] know he in here somewhere do I have to pick up the paper again oh C down no I don't have to is this really a dead end it could just be for the file oh that the the broken lag is so annoying so bad typical Russian Sports Hall School yeah looks like a Dutch one too just looks like a school sports Hall like a gymnasium I never went there but I've been there like once or twice and uh so I know what it looks like um all the other times that was my time to just go home and play World of Warcraft like that was my queue like oh you we're going to do sports with school no we're not got a [ __ ] Warrior to level [ __ ] ah there we go oh [ __ ] one more I try and I try you all betray

that's crazy you're lion oh was it four Helen grut Rudolph bck face out Dear s groundw work has been laid to ensure uneventful eress for rudol Warnick from structural and financial systems at Mount Massi his Advanced age should have uh should alleviate any suspicions among contractors and employees among whom he has cheerfully nicknamed the Crypt Keeper haven't had any dates to begin with this this don't you remember it's crazy it's crazy crazyy um legally speaking he died years ago I understand patience 14306 d8 14279 D1 and 1486 8-1 have already been scheduled for Transit we're all terribly excited at a obvious profit potential of the new project my researchers have come through verx files and found no mention of the three lucid dream dreamers I think we could safely assume wernick was sufficiently distracted by the partial success of patient Billy hope along with this own infirmity um to be ignored of the real Discovery at hand even minimal exploitation of these resources hard to overestimate only hope the new facility is sufficiently shielded to allow female staff so I can see what comes with my own eyes hello housekeeping multiple officers down why does my back [Music] hurt I remember I'm almost 30 years old that's why I have a neck in my back well I was at a concert yesterday so I guess that's why I honestly no clue like shit's going fast there's soldiers in here now the doctor is dead on the ground old age is so fun it it really is but I'm super stubborn too because like I still dive into the msh bit and then after 10 minutes I'm I'm just going to complain for the next like 3 hours that everything hurts why do I even do that why not just accept that my body is now completely ready to stand in the back enjoy a beer and not move I'm walking in circles not have been here I'm so confused he seems fine he'll sleep it off oh hey we're like at the beginning of the game [Music] B Santa uh transfer for the the three Loy dreamers um

to information regarding the patients new security clearances will be issued and appropriate Protocol signed hi Pony how you doing I had one birthday last week one year closer to death next year Al 30

justice but once you click upload your life is over everyone you love is [ __ ] but it's the right thing to do all right St that much to you [Music] and that's why it's called um the whistle blower
